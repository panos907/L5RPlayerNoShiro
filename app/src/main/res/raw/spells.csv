SENSE    1    ALL    Personal'    50'    Instantaneous    This spell can be cast in any of the four standard elements. It allows the caster to sense the presence, quantity, and rough location of elemental spirits (not the evil spirits known as kansen) of that element within the range of the spell. This is most frequently applied when looking for spirits with which to Commune (see below), but can also be useful as a crude, basic location device. For example, a caster lost in the wilderness could cast Sense (Water) in hopes of locating a source of drinking water
SUMMON    1    ALL    30'    1 cubic foot of summoned material'    Permanent    This spell can be cast in any of the four standard elements. It allows the caster to summon a modest quantity (one cubic foot) of the chosen element. The summoned matter appears (usually in a rough ball shape) in any open space within the spell’s range. This cannot place the summoned material inside another physical object or living creature. The summoned element will behave in a normal and mundane matter – earth falls to the ground, water soaks anything it lands on, air blows away, and fi re winks out unless there is something present for it to burn. In general it is impossible to use this spell effectively in combat, although clever shugenja may find a few modest combat uses, such as using Summon (Fire) to ignite a foe soaked in cooking oil. More commonly, the spell’s value is in simpler functions, such as summoning Water while in a desert, or summoning Fire to light a campfire without flint and tinder. Raises may be used with this spell to summon a more specific type of the appropriate element, such as wood or iron with Earth, or tea with Water. The GM should choose how many Raises (generally anywhere from 1 to 4) this requires. However, these Raises cannot be used to create rare/precious materials (such as gold) or spiritually powerful substances (such as jade or crystal).
COMMUNE    1    ALL    20'    Self    Concentration    This spell can be cast in any element save Void. It allows the caster to speak with one of the local elemental kami, asking it a few questions, which it will answer honestly to the best of its ability. Typically this spell will invoke the most active and energetic spirit of the chosen element in the area of effect; if all of the local spirits are quiescent, the GM may require the caster to call 1 or 2 Raises to “wake up” a local spirit enough to answer questions. A spirit reached with Commune will answer two questions. The caster may Raise to get more questions (one per Raise). The caster may also Raise for clarity, to get a more accurate and informative answer to the questions. (Kami are notorious for their inability to fully comprehend human behavior, and asking questions without Raises for clarity can often result in confusing, enigmatic, or incomplete answers.) Spirits do not forget anything, so theoretically a shugenja can ask a spirit about something that happened decades ago; however, they also do not experience time in the same way as mortals, so trying to ask about something from long ago will usually require Raises in order to make the caster’s wishes clear to the spirit.
BLESSED WIND    1    AIR    Personal    10' radius around the caster    Concentration    You summon a swirling aura of winds to protect you from ranged attacks. The buffeting winds defl ect arrows and other projectiles. While you maintain your concentration, this spell adds +15 to your Armor TN versus all non-magical ranged attacks.
BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON    1    AIR    Personal    20' radius around the caster    1 minute    You call upon the kami to reveal that which has been hidden. All concealed objects within the area of effect appear as slightly luminous outlines to you. Any non-magical concealment is revealed, including secret compartments, trap doors, concealed weapons, etc. Only you can see the presence of these objects.
CLOAK OF NIGHT    1    AIR    Touch    One object    1 hour    You can call upon the kami to wrap an object in their embrace, hiding it from the sight of mortal beings. You may target any one non-living object smaller than you. This object becomes invisible to the naked eye. Attempts to perceive it magically will automatically succeed if the Mastery Level of the spell used is higher than that of this spell. Spells of equal Mastery Level require a Contested Air Roll to detect the hidden object. The object is still physically present and can be touched, smelled, or sensed with any normal sense other than vision.
LEGACY OF KAZE-NO-KAMI    1    AIR    School Rank x10 miles    One known individual within range    Special    You are able to call upon the spirits of the wind to take formas a bird and carry a message for you. The bird that is created by this spell appears perfectly normal in all regards, but if it takes any damage it dissipates into wind immediately, ending the spell. Upon creating the bird, you may speak to it, giving it a spoken message of up to one minute in length. The bird will then fl y away to deliver the message to the person (or persons) specifi ed when the spell is cast. The bird will fl y to their location, deliver the message via a whisper (it can be overheard by others, but not easily), and then disappear. If the bird is unable to reach the individual, but they are within range (if they are within a building with no windows, for instance) it will remain outside waiting for up to one week before disappearing. If the person specifi ed by the spell is not within range, the bird will fl y away in a random direction and disappear when it is out of your line of sight.
NATURE’S TOUCH    1    AIR    10'    One creature    Special    You are able to use the spirits of the wind to speak to an animal and ensure that it understands what you are saying. This spell works only on natural animals, and will not work with Shadowlands creatures or creatures from other realms. It does not guarantee that the animal will regard you positively or that it will fulfill requests made of it, but the creature will understand anything you tell it (within its ability to do so, naturally – political relationships will have no meaning to a horse, no matter how many times you explain them). This spell lasts as long as you maintain your full and undivided attention on the animal and continue speaking to it.
TEMPEST OF AIR    1    AIR    Personal    A cone 75’ long and 15’ wide at its end    Instantaneous    You summon a powerful gust of air emanating from your position that crashes into all in its path, knocking them to the ground. All targets within the area of effect suffer 1k1 Wounds and must make a Contested Roll using their Earth against your Air. Every target that fails suffers Knockdown.
TOKEN OF MEMORY    1    AIR    10'    One small (1 cubic foot or smaller) illusory object    1 hour    You can create a flawless illusion of one object. The item appears real in every way up until the spell expires, at which point it disappears. If you are attempting to create a specific, familiar object, such as another samurai’s katana, you must declare one Raise, and that individual may make a Contested Roll using his Perception against the total of your Spell Casting Roll to detect the forgery. Images created by this spell are completely stationary, and if placed in a situation where they must move (such as floating in water), disappear instantly. An image of a katana could be created sitting on a rack, for example, but not in a samurai’s obi because it would not be able to move with the samurai. Objects created with this spell have no true physical substance and cannot bear weight or inflict damage.
TO SEEK THE TRUTH    1    AIR    Personal/Touch    One individual touched (may be the caster)    5 minutes    You call upon the wind to purge the mind of your target, granting him clarity. This spell may negate temporary mental or social penalties suffered as a result of a mechanical effect, including Techniques, Wound Ranks, or other spells. The TN of the Spell Casting Roll made to cast this spell is increased by an amount equal to the Technique Rank, Wound Rank, or spell Mastery Level used to create the penalty in the first place. Disadvantages permanently possessed by an individual may not be countered using this spell.
WAY OF DECEPTION    1    AIR    20'    One illusory duplicate of the caster    Concentration plus 5 minutes    You can entreat the capricious spirits of the wind to create a perfect duplicate image of you a short distance away. The illusion exactly reflects your appearance at the time the spell is cast, including your clothing and any equipment. The illusion may appear anywhere within the spell’s range, and will perform whatever actions you perform while it is in effect. (If you sit down, for instance, your duplicate will sit down as well, even if there is nothing to sit on.) Once you leave the normal range of the spell, the duplicate disappears. If you make two Raises on the Spell Casting Roll, you may leave the area of effect and the illusion will remain in whatever position it was in when you left for as long as you continue concentrating on maintaining the spell.
YARI OF AIR    1    AIR    Personal or 20'    One created weapon    5 minutes    You summon a swirling meleeWeapon of pure air, only visible as a foggy outline. The meleeWeapon’s default form is a yari, but one Raise can change its form to any other spear of your choosing. The meleeWeapon has DR 1k1. If you do not possess the Spears Skill, you may instead use your School Rank in its place. If you do possess the Spears Skill, using this meleeWeapon grants you one Free Raise that can only be used on the Feint or Increased Damage Maneuvers. This meleeWeapon disappears if is lost from your hand. Instead of summoning the yari for yourself, you may cause it to appear in the hands of an ally within 20 feet. He is treated as the caster for all purposes of the spell, but he does not gain the Free Raise bonus.
BENTEN’S TOUCH    2    AIR    Personal/Touch    Target individual (may be the caster)    1 hour    By calling upon the air kami to whisper suggestions to others, you may cause them to perceive the target of this spell more positively than they otherwise might. The target of this spell gains a bonus of +1k1, plus your Air Ring, to the total of all Social Skill rolls made for the duration of the spell. 
CALL UPON THE WIND    2    AIR    Personal or 20'    Target individual (may be the caster)    1 minute    The winds can lift and buoy, carrying even the heaviest burden into the skies for short periods. The target of this spell gains a limited form of fl ight, allowing him to move through the air unimpeded. The target of the spell may make Free Move Actions, but not Simple Move Actions, and may never move more than 10’ per round. Heavy winds can interfere with this movement or prevent it altogether. At the end of the spell’s duration, the target drifts harmlessly to the ground, no matter how high he might be.
HIDDEN VISAGE    2    AIR    Personal    Self    5 minutes    Air kami are mischievous and capricious, and enjoy anything they perceive as a joke. You may call upon them to create a subtle illusion, altering your facial features just enough that you appear to be a different person. This spell does not allow you to impersonate specifi c individuals, or even people radically different from you. You appear as a person of the same age, build, race, and gender. The differences are subtle, enough so that you could be mistaken for your own brother or cousin.
THE KAMI’S WHISPER    2    AIR    50'    10' radius    1 round    The kami of the wind can carry whispers for great distances, and can even create them if properly entreated. You can petition the kami to create a false sound, either a voice or a natural sound such as an animal’s growl or running water, for example. The sound can be no louder than a normal speaking voice, and cannot impersonate a specific person’s voice. If used to create the sound of a voice, the spell is limited to twenty words.
MISTS OF ILLUSION    2    AIR    20'    10' radius    1 minute    With greater fluency with the kami comes the ability to craft increasingly convincing images from the stuff of the wind itself. You may create illusions of any object, individual, or image that you can imagine. These images are stationary, and they must fi t within the spell’s area of effect, but they can be as simple or complex as desired. These illusions are visual only, with no auditory component, no odors, etc.
SECRETS ON THE WIND    2    AIR    10 miles    20' radius    Concentration    The kami can carry whispers across an Empire, if properly entreated to do so. This spell requires you to perform a preparation ritual in order to cast it effectively. The ritual requires ten minutes of uninterrupted meditation in the area designated as the spell’s area of effect. Any time within the 48 hours immediately following this ritual, you may cast this spell, and overhear anything being said in the prepared area. If your concentration is disrupted, the effect ends and may not be renewed without an additional preparation ritual. Only one area may be prepared via this ritual at one time.
WHISPERING WIND    2    AIR    20'     Target individual    Instantaneous    The air kami see very little difference between speech and thought, and can perceive both with relative ease. By comparing the two, the kami can determine if what has been spoken is true, or a lie. Unfortunately, they have notoriously short attention spans, and thus can only assess extremely recent conversations. By invoking this spell, you may determine if the last thing said by the target was true or false. The kami have no concept of personal opinion, however, and if the target truly believes what he said was true, the kami will believe it as well.
WOLF’S PROPOSAL    2    AIR    Personal    Self    10 minutes    This spell, crafted to facilitate initial relations between groups, is easily twisted to nefarious purposes. It calls the kami to create a subtle aura of suggestion around the caster, one that does not disguise the caster but rather causes others to perceive him as slightly more benevolent than perhaps he truly is. For the duration of this spell, your Honor Rank is considered three ranks higher for the purposes of any Lore: Bushido rolls made to determine your Honor Rank.
ESSENCE OF AIR    3    AIR    Personal    Self    5 rounds    Air can be merged with the essence of a mortal, and doing so can impart tremendous abilities, albeit at great risk to the caster. You mix with the wind itself and become insubstantial. You may not interact with any physical objects while insubstantial, although you do remain on the ground, and you may pass through solid objects at a rate of one foot per round. Your Water Ring is considered halved (rounded down) while you remain insubstantial, and you may not cast any other spells until you return to solidity.
THE EYE SHALL NOT SEE    3    AIR    Personal or Touch    Self or target individual    Concentration    You call upon the kami to create an area of distraction surrounding you, drawing all attention away from you and your actions. The kami whisper in the ears of those within 20’ of you (or of the target if you cast the spell on someone else), causing them to be conveniently distracted from your presence. You are not invisible, but those within 20’ of you will not see you as long as you do not make any loud noises or otherwise draw attention to yourself. Those outside that distance are not distracted, however, and will see you perfectly well regardless of your action or inaction.
MASK OF WIND    3    AIR    Personal    Self    1 hour    A skilled shugenja can petition the kami to create incredibly elaborate illusions to obscure one’s identity and appearance. You may use this spell to adopt the appearance of any humanoid creature of approximately the same size, up to one foot taller or shorter than you. You could use this spell to assume the guise of a kenku, for example, because they are roughly the same size as humans. A goblin or an ogre would be impossible, however, because they are too short and too large, respectively.
STRIKING THE STORM    3    AIR    Personal    Self    3 rounds    The most powerful winds can turn aside not only arrows, but steel as well. You may summon a buffet of winds that surrounds you in an unrelenting cocoon of swirling air. Your Armor TN is increased by +20 against both melee and ranged attacks. The force of the winds surrounding you prevents you from hearing others if they speak to you, however.
SUMMONING THE GALE    3    AIR    50'    Target individual (may be the caster)    Concentration    Swirling winds can be commanded to circle a designated target, preventing ranged attacks being made in either direction. This spell affects an area thirty feet around the target in all directions. Everyone within the affected area gains a +15 bonus to their Armor TN against ranged attacks. However, everyone within the area also suffers a penalty of -3k3 to all ranged attack rolls.
SUMMON FOG    3    AIR    100'    50' radius    1 minute    The kami can be petitioned to coalesce in an area as they do on the coast, creating a thick, obscuring fog. Within the area affected by your spell, the visibility is decreased to a meager fi ve feet. Fabrics and other absorbent materials within the spell’s area of effect will become damp or even wet if they remain within it long enough. Small sources of open fl ame, such as candles, might be extinguished as well, at the GM’s discretion. The moistness of fog is extremely damaging to rice paper.
YOUR HEART’S ENEMY    3    AIR    25'    One target individual    5 rounds    The kami can see into the hearts of mortals, and can use that information at a shugenja’s request. You manifest the kami as an illusion of the thing your target fears most in the world. It may be an individual (the man who killed his father), or an item (a cursed blade that brought ruin to his family), or even a vista of some sort (an image of an enemy slaying his family). This effectively generates Fear 4 that the target must overcome (see the Book of Earth for rules regarding Fear). Only the target can see the specifi cs of the illusion; others see only a hazy outline that appears to be a small fog cloud.
CALL THE SPIRIT    4    AIR    Special    Target spirit    5 minutes    Essentially an extremely powerful, specifi c form of the basic spell Summon, Call the Spirit allows a shugenja to summon any particular spirit, regardless of its realm, to have a discussion. You may use this spell to summon any spirit from any of the spirit realms, although realm denizens that are not spirits (such as Fortunes) are immune. If you know something specific about the spirit, either having seen it before or having intimate knowledge of its actions (for example, “the spirit that killed my father”), you may summon that spirit in particular. The nature of the spell prevents the spirit from attacking you unless you attack fi rst, but it will not necessarily be friendly. The spirit disappears as soon as the spell’s duration expires. This spell can potentially summon extremely dangerous creatures, such as oni, and should be used with caution.
FALSE REALM    4    AIR    250'    100' radius    1 hour    The greatest masters of the wind can create illusions of such beauty and clarity that those affected by them might truly believe they were somewhere else. You can completely alter the appearance of the terrain within the area of effect of this spell. You can make a miserable swamp look, sound, and smell like a beautiful garden, or vice versa. Although these illusions can be extraordinarily intricate and completely convincing to all other senses, they still have no substance and cannot be touched.
GIFT OF WIND    4    AIR    Personal    Self    5 minutes    The ultimate gift of the wind spirits is to become like the wind itself: unseen. The wind kami surround you and render you completely invisible. No non-magical vision can detect your presence. You can still be touched, heard, and smelled, but unless you attack someone else, you remain invisible for the duration of the spell. The kami consider attacking someone to be ruining the joke, and immediately end the spell’s effect if you do so.
KNOW THE MIND    4    AIR    10'    Target individual    3 rounds    Although the ultimate secrets of the human mind are hidden even to the winds, air kami can pluck the most immediate thoughts from the minds of others and whisper them to those who carry their favor. For the duration of this spell, you essentially hear the surface thoughts of the spell’s target. You only learn things they are actively thinking about. For example, if you asked the name of the target’s daughter, that name would appear in their mind instantly even if they had no intention of speaking it aloud. A Contested Roll using your Perception against the target’s Awareness will also allow you to assess their true emotional state, regardless of how they appear physically.
NATSUKE OF WIND    4    AIR    Touch    One hand-held object    1 hour    Although it requires great favor, the air kami are willing to coalesce into a solid form for a short period of time if they are fond enough of the priest asking them. You may create a small object out of the air itself, something that can be held in one or both hands and that does not weigh more than twenty pounds at the most. This creation is an illusion, but it can be used functionally, including infl icting damage if it is a weapon. The object disappears completely at the end of the spell’s duration.
SYMBOL OF AIR    4    AIR    Touch    Special    Permanent    Priests of the kami are capable of inscribing powerful wards that invoke the power of the elements against all who attempt to pass them. A Symbol of Air must be inscribed on a solid object, most often a door, window, gate, or other passageway. Anyone attempting to pass through this passageway or otherwise pass by the area protected by the Symbol is affected by the protective ward. Such persons must succeed at a Contested Roll using their Earth against the caster’s Air. Those who fail are affected by a powerful drowsiness, and must succeed at a Willpower Roll against the total of the Spell Casting Roll used to create the ward or fall into a deep sleep for one hour. Those affected by the spell cannot be woken by normal means, but will awaken instantly if subjected to any attack or form of harm, as the kami will not be party to such humorless tricks. You may only have one Symbol of Air in existence at any time, and Symbol spells of different elements may never affect the same area. This spell may be dispelled by another casting of Symbol of Air from any shugenja, or by destroying the surface where the Symbol was etched.
CLOUD THE MIND    4    AIR    Touch    One target individual    Permanent    This extremely invasive spell is considered blasphemous by most honorable shugenja, and many respectable shugenja orders would fi nd its use reason for excommunication if not outright execution. This spell calls upon the air kami to befuddle and dismay a target, invading their mind and infl uencing their ability to recall exactly what happened to them over a certain length of time. When this spell is successfully cast against a target, you must succeed at a Contested Roll using your Air versus the target’s Earth. If successful, the target’s memories are disrupted, and they forget what has happened to them over the course of the past week (fi ve days). This information is completely lost to the target. What’s more, the spell renders them extremely susceptible to suggestion, and you can tell them what happened to them over the course of the missing time. This allows unscrupulous shugenja to exploit others and essentially give them false memories, although certain individuals are highly resistant to this manner of manipulation. It is possible to determine that an individual was the target of this spell through use of the Commune spell, but it requires that the kami be specifi cally asked if they can detect any such manipulation.
DRAW BACK THE SHADOW    5    AIR    100'    30' radius    Instantaneous    Just as the kami craft illusions, they can cast them aside. Within the area affected by this spell, any illusions created by spells of Mastery Level 4 or lower are automatically dispelled. Spells of Mastery Level 5 or 6 require a Contested Air Roll between you and the shugenja who created those spells; if you are successful, those illusions are dispelled as well. Ongoing magical effects that are not illusions may also be dispelled by this spell, but require a Contested Ring Roll between you and their creator, using your Air versus his appropriate Ring.
ECHOES ON THE BREEZE    5    AIR    Personal    One target individual    Concentration    No destination is beyond the reach of the wind. With a simple prayer to the kami, you can send your words across the span of the Empire, whispering into the ear of anyone you need to send a message. The person must be someone you know, and the spell will establish a link between the two of you only as long as you concentrate. You may communicate with one another, although you only hear each other’s voices as whispers. Both participants are instantly aware when the connection is forged, and either can end it at any point.
LEGION OF THE MOON    5    AIR    Personal    10' radius from the caster    5 minutes    The Moon can reveal what is hidden, but also conceal those who receive its blessings. You may summon the greater blessing of the Moon and envelop a large group of people within it, completely obscuring them from sight. Every individual you choose within the area of effect of this spell is rendered invisible to all normal senses for the duration of the spell. Those within the area that you choose to exclude are not affected. Anyone affected by the spell who performs any action that physically interacts with an unaffected individual is immediately excluded from the spell effect.
SLAYER'S KNIVES    5    AIR    30'    Corridor of the air 10' wide    Instantaneous    The wind can be deadly to those unprepared for its fury. You summon a powerful wind that tears through anything in its path. At your behest, the kami create a corridor of air filled with a cutting wind that inflicts damage with a DR equal to your Air Ring +2k0 to everything in its path. (For example, a shugenja with Air 4 would infl ict 6k4 damage with this spell). Paper and light cloth are destroyed instantly, although heavier cloth may only be damaged. Anyone damaged by these winds must succeed at an Earth Ring Roll (TN 20) or be Knocked Down.
RISE, AIR    6    AIR    30'    One summoned spirit    Concentration    The wind itself will take form to defend you. The ultimate actualization of the Summon spell, this spell summons a massive kami of pure air to serve you. It takes the form of a vaguely humanoid shape, roughly ten feet in height, with an indistinct outline visible only because of small debris caught up in its body. The kami may move up to 10’ x your Air per round, and generates powerful winds in a twenty foot radius around it that hinder movement, preventing anyone from making Simple Move Actions within its area of effect. The manifest kami is treated as if it has all Physical Traits equal to your Air Ring, and attacks with a Jiujitsu Skill Rank equal to half your Air Ring. Damage from these attacks has a DR equal to your Air Ring (for example, a spirit summoned by a shugenja with Air 6 would infl ict 6k6 damage with its attacks). For purposes of taking damage, the spirit is considered to have Wounds as though it were a human with Earth equal to your Air Ring, but suffers no Wound penalties. It is Invulnerable (see the creature rules in the Book of Void for details of this ability). If it is successfully reduced to zero Wounds, it is dispelled.
THE FALSE LEGION    6    AIR    Personal    Within 100' of the caster    Concentration    The greatest illusory gift of the wind is legion. Within the area of effect of this spell, you can create a number of illusory figures up to your Air Ring x 10. These fi gures may be as detailed or as vague as you prefer (such as “Crane bushi” versus “heavy infantry of the fourth Daidoji legion”), although you must be familiar with their appearance in order for this spell to take effect (you could not, for example, replicate a family mon you have never seen). The fi gures are fully mobile and will take whatever actions you desire as long as they do not leave the spell’s area of effect. They can be seen, heard, or even smelled, but as with most illusions, they cannot physically interact with objects or individuals in any way.
WRATH OF KAZE-NO-KAMI(HURRICANE)    6    AIR    Personal    1 mile radius, centered on the caster    Concentration (special)    The wrath of the air kami, and of the Fortune of the Wind, is truly dreadful to behold. In casting this spell, you unleashthe full force of a hurricane upon your enemies. When the spell takes effect, you are standing in the eye of the storm, a zone radiating twenty feet in every direction from you, and in which no ill effects of the spell are suffered. Outside the eye, however, the brutal effects of the storm tear at everything in its path. Objects weighing less than fi ve hundred pounds are lifted by the wind and tossed into the storm. Individuals in this area must hold on to something immobile or be cast into the winds to their certain death. Everyone within the affected region who does not have sturdy shelter suffers 1k1 Wounds per minute from the winds and minor debris. There is a one in ten chance each minute that an exposed individual will instead suffer 5k5 Wounds due to being struck by a wind-borne object. This spell lasts for a maximum of one hour, although it can last far shorter times if you are disrupted while maintaining the spell. This spell may not be cast in a given area more than once per month, as it completelyexhausts the favors of the air kami to perform it.
ARMOR OF EARTH    1    EARTH    Personal    Self    10 rounds    This spell infuses the caster’s body with the strength of Earth, weakening the force of any physical or magical attack which strikes him. For the duration of the spell, you gain Reduction in an amount equal to your Earth Ring + School Rank. However, this infusion of Earth slows your movements – your Water is considered 1 Rank lower for purposes of movement while you are under the effects of this spell.
COURAGE OF THE SEVEN THUNDERS    1    EARTH    30'    Targets up to caster's Shugenja Shool Rank    10 minutes    This spell infuses the targets (who may include the caster) with fi rm and unyielding courage, bolstered by the eternal power of the Earth. For the duration of the spell, all the targets gain +5k0 to resist any kind of Fear effect, whether magical or natural. However, this spell is associated with the memory of the legendary Seven Thunders, and those whose connection to the Thunders is tenuous do not receive the same degree of blessing from the Earth kami. Samurai who are not of the original Seven Great Clans receive only +3k0 to their rolls to resist Fear. Anyone who has at least a full Rank of Shadowlands Taint cannot benefi t from this spell, although this will not actually reveal that they are Tainted. This spell may be cast as a combined ritual by two or more shugenja who know the spell, in which case they may add their highest single Earth Rank to their combined total School Ranks to determine how many targets the spell can affect.
EARTH’S STAGNATION    1    EARTH    50'    One target    6 rounds    This spell calls on the Earth in the target’s body to weigh him down, impeding his movements. The target suffers a –2k0 penalty to all rolls using the Agility trait, and his Water Ring is considered 1 Rank lower for the purpose of how far he can move.
EARTH’S TOUCH    1    EARTH    Touch    One target    1 hour    With this spell, the shugenja calls forth the Earth of the target (which may be himself), invoking the kami to strengthen his health and mental fortitude. For the duration of the spell, one of the target’s Earth Traits (chosen by the caster) is increased by 1. This does not increase the Ring itself, but it can enhance the target’s ability to withstand temptation, resist poisons, or dominate others.
ELEMENTAL WARD    1    EARTH    Touch    One target    1 hour    This spell uses the power of Earth to enhance resistance to hostile magic. The spirits of Earth armor the target’s body and soul, rejecting other kami when they try to affect the target. When the shugenja casts this spell, he chooses one Element (which cannot be Void or Maho). Spells of that element suffer a TN penalty equal to the caster’s School Rank x 5 when they are cast on anyone under the protection of this spell. (Unfortunately, this includes “friendly” magic such as healing.)
JADE STRIKE    1    EARTH    100'    One target    Instantaneous    This spell summons forth the purest of Earth kami, those of jade, in the form of a blast of iridescent green energy. The jade power fl ies out and unerringly strikes the chosen target – it cannot be intercepted or defl ected, although Magic Resistance or other forms of magical defense can thwart it. If the target has at least one Rank of Taint, the Jade Strike will infl ict damage with a DR of 3k3, burning and blackening the Tainted fl esh. However, a target who does not have at least a full Rank of Taint will not suffer any damage from the spell. Casting Jade Strike on a non-Tainted target is generally regarded as a grave insult – except perhaps among the more paranoid ranks of the Kuni family, where it is seen as merely a sensible precaution.
JUROJIN’S BALM    1    EARTH    Touch    One target    1 hour    This spell fills the target’s body with the purity and vigor of Earth, driving out poisons and impurities. If the target suffers the effects of any poison or toxin within the duration of the spell, or is already under the effects of a poison when the spell targets him, he may re-roll any failed Stamina roll to resist the poison, with a bonus of +2k0 to the second roll. (However, if the second roll is also failed, the poison has full effect.) An interesting side-effect of this spell is that it also cures drunkenness and other such effects, and it is impossible for the target to become intoxicated during the spell’s duration.
MINOR BINDING    1    EARTH    60'    One target    2 hours    This spell was pioneered by the Kuni family but has come into use among other shugenja who battle the forces of the Shadowlands, such as the Scorpion and the Phoenix. It is used to safely imprison minor Shadowlands creatures, typically for purposes of interrogation. Any Shadowlands creature with an Earth of 3 or less can be targeted with this spell. It cannot affect the Lost, Oni Lords or their spawn, or creatures with an Earth of 4 or higher, nor can it affect creatures who are not Tainted. If the spell is cast successfully, it calls forth manacles of iron, formed from pure Earth spirits, which trap and bind the target creature, rendering it physically helpless for the duration of the spell. When the spell expires, the manacles instantly crumble away into dust.
SOUL OF STONE    1    EARTH    Touch    One target    1 hour    This spell fi lls the target’s soul with the fi rm and unyielding strength of stone. For the duration of the spell, the target’s feelings are immovable, and any attempt to divert or distract him will be resisted with supernatural determination. He gains a +3k0 bonus to any rolls made to resist emotional manipulation or the distractions of desire, including Courtier (Manipulation) rolls, Temptation rolls, Compulsions, and any similar effects which the GM judges to be appropriate. However, this stony self-control also makes it difficult for the target to read and affect the emotions of others, and for the duration of the spell he suffers a –1k0 penalty to all Awareness Trait rolls and Awareness-related Skill Rolls made for the purpose of influencing others.
TETSUBO OF EARTH    1    EARTH    Personal or 20'    One created weapon    5 minutes    You summon a tetsubo of pure earth, studded with all manner of stones. The meleeWeapon’s default form is a tetsubo, but one Raise can change its form to any other heavy meleeWeapon of your choosing. The tetsubo has a DR of 2k2. When wielding this meleeWeapon, you may use your School Rank in place of your Heavy Weapons Skill if you wish. If you do have the Heavy Weapon skill, the tetsubo grants you a Free Raise for the Knockdown maneuver (this bonus does not apply if you grant the Tetsubo to another person instead of wielding it yourself). The tetsubo disappears if it is lost from your hand. Instead of summoning the tetsubo for yourself, you may cause it to appear in the hands of an ally within 20 feet. He is treated as the caster for all purposes of the spell, but does not gain the Free Raise bonus.
BE THE MOUNTAIN    2    EARTH    30'    One target creature    4 rounds    A variant of the spell Armor of Earth, designed to protect allies, this prayer causes the Earth kami to envelop the target with their embrace, covering his skin with a stony barrier that repels physical blows. The target gains Reduction of a value equal to 5x the caster’s School Rank, to a maximum of 20, but cannot take Simple Move Actions for the duration of the spell (Free Move Actions are still allowed). Only a willing ally can be targeted with this spell.
EARTH BECOMES SKY    2    EARTH    100'    One target creature    Instantaneous    This spell summons up several huge boulders from the earth, and hurls them through the air to unerringly strike one (or more) target creatures. The target struck by these boulders suffers damage with a DR equal to the caster’s Earth rank. If the caster strikes multiple targets, the DR is reduced by 1k1 for each additional target, to a minimum of 1k1 damage per target. These boulders are made of normal, mundane stone, and thus cannot normally bypass Reduction or Invulnerability, but a powerful caster can infuse the boulders with the power of Jade.
EMBRACE OF KENRO-JI-JIN    2    EARTH    Personal or Touch    One target creature    1 hour    This spell allows the target (who can be the caster or one other person) to literally dive into the ground, which becomes as clear and easy to traverse as water for him. He can see for a distance of 100 yards through the earth, and can move through it in any direction as easily as though he were in normal air. The target can see through the edge of the earth into the normal world, but he cannot attack, cast spells, speak, hear, or otherwise interact with those outside the earth unless he emerges from the ground (at which point the spell immediately ends). If the spell ends while the target is still underground, the Earth spirits are offended by the target’s continued presence, and immediately expel him into the nearest open air, wherever that might be.
FORCE OF WILL    2    EARTH    50'    One target    2 rounds    This spell infuses the target with an intense resistance to painand death, as the Earth kami bolster his will to live to superhuman levels. He is able to shrug off the pain and shock of his wounds, even continuing in the face of lethal injuries for a short time. For the duration of this spell, the target is immune to all Wound Rank penalties and effects – including the effect of being dead if the Out rank is completely fi lled. When the spell expires, however, the full effects of any Wounds apply immediately – thus, this spell typically affords either a brief chance to be healed before it is too late, or the chance to wage a fi nal battle in the face of certain death.
GRASP OF EARTH    2    EARTH    50'    One target    5 rounds    This spell causes the Earth kami to reach up and seize hold of the target, often taking the form of a massive hand or claw which grips the unfortunate creature in stony digits. The target is rendered near-immobile, able to move only 3’ per round as a Simple Move Action, and unable to move at all with a Free Move Action. The target may break free by spending a Complex Action and rolling Raw Strength at a TN equal to 5x the caster’s Earth.
HANDS OF CLAY    2    EARTH    Personal    Self    10 minutes    This spell infuses Earth spirits into the hands and feet of thecaster, allowing them to merge with the Earth found in wood, earth, and stone. This allows the caster to walk and climb along sheer surfaces, including walls and cliffs, at half his normal movement speed (rounded up). He can even hang from ceilings and move along them, although in that case he can only move 3’ with a Simple Action. When the spell ends, the effect concludes without warning, possibly leading to a painful fall.
THE MOUNTAIN’S FEET    2    EARTH    Personal or 20'    One target    1 hour    This spell fortifi es the target by rooting his feet to the stone and soil beneath, allowing him to shrug off anything that might separate him from the touch of Earth. The target gains +3k0 to resist all Knockdown maneuvers, and any spell which seeks to knock down the target, lift him into the air, or otherwise break his connection to the Earth must win a Contested roll of the spell’s Element against the caster’s Earth.
WHOLENESS OF THE WORLD    2    EARTH    Personal or 20'    One target creature    10 minutes    This spell infuses the target with the strength of Earth to such a degree that his Rings and Traits become wholly resistant to any effort to change them. Any physical or magical effect which would raise or lower his Traits or Rings is completely ineffective for the duration of this spell, as the Earth kami fi rmly rebuff any such efforts to alter the target’s Elemental balance.
BONDS OF NINGEN-DO    3    EARTH    500'    One target spirit creature    30 days    This spell, a more powerful and specialized form of Minor Binding, is a ritual designed to bind or dispel troublesome creatures from the various spirit realms. Any creature from the realms of Sakkaku, Chikushudo, Gaki-Do, Toshigoku, or Yume-Do can be affected by this spell. Casting it requires 10 minutes, although if additional shugenja who know the spell assist in the ritual, the time is reduced by 1 minute per additional shugenja, to a minimum of 1 minute. If the targeted creature is within range of the caster(s) when the spell is successfully completed, the creature can be either bound or dispelled. If it is bound, it must obey the caster’s commands for the duration of the spell, although suicidal commands will break the spell – this is how the Kuni have forced mujina spirits to labor for them in their iron mines. (It should be noted that this use of the spell is considered controversial and even blasphemous by many in Rokugan.) If the creature is dispelled, it immediately leaves Ningen-Do for its native spirit realm, and cannot return until the spell’s duration ends. Either way, the spirit creature will regard the caster as an enemy thereafter, and is likely to seek vengeance if it can.
EARTH KAMI’S BLESSING    3    EARTH    Personal or 20'    Caster or one target creature    10 minutes    This spell infuses the target (which may be the caster or one of his allies) with the strength and resilience of the Earth, making him tougher and more fi rm-minded. For the duration of the spell, the target gains +2 Wounds per Wound Rank, and gains +1k1 on all rolls involving the Earth Ring and its associated Traits. When the spell expires, any Wounds the target has suffered still remain, and this may drive him into a lower Wound Rank or even kill him.
EARTH’S PROTECTION    3    EARTH    Personal    10' radius from caster    Concentration    This spell calls on the spirits of Earth to protect the area around the caster from the effects of the other three Elements (Air, Fire, and Water) for a short time. While the caster concentrates on maintaining the favor of the Earth spirits, the effects of spells which call on those other three elements are mitigated. Any hostile Air, Fire, or Water spell cast within the  area of Earth’s Protection, or extending its effects into that area, will suffer a +10 TN penalty to the Spell Casting roll. In addition, any damage which those spells inflict on creatures within Earth’s Protection will be reduced by 1k1 (to a minimum of 1k1).
PURGE THE TAINT    3    EARTH    Personal    50' radius around caster    Permanent    This spell was originally created by the Kuni family and is still primarily practiced by them, although knowledge of its prayers has spread to other Clans. It is an elaborate ritual spell, requiring an hour to cast, that calls on the powers of Earth to purge the land of the Shadowlands Taint, driving out all the evil kansen in the area. The spell will remove all the Taint from the land, plant life, and inanimate objects within the area of effect. It will not remove Taint from living creatures, nor will it affect powerful Tainted artifacts or objects made of obsidian. The removal of the Taint, however, is not without price. The elemental kami in the area of effect are also weakened and purged by the spell, especially the Earth spirits whose efforts are called upon to power it. In the aftermath of casting this spell, the local spirits will be scattered and weakened, infl icting a +15 TN penalty on all Spell Casting rolls within the area. This negative effect will sometimes fade with time, especially if it was cast in a single location surrounded by normal lands. But if the spell is cast over a wide area, such as the Kuni Wastes, the elemental kami will usually permanently leave the area, reducing it to a gray, lifeless wasteland.
SHARING THE STRENGTH OF MANY    3    EARTH    30'    One to six target persons withins range    5 round    This spell infuses its targets, up to six people (who can include the caster), with the power of Earth, allowing them each to call upon the Earth of their comrades to bolster their efforts. For the duration of the spell, the lowest Earth Ring Rank among all the targets is added to the total of all Ring, Trait, and Skill rolls (but not Spell Casting rolls) they make.
STRENGTH OF THE CROW    3    EARTH    Touch    One target    Hours equal to caster's Shugenja School    This spell infuses the target (who can be the caster) with a powerful resistance to the Shadowlands Taint, repelling the dark kansen of the Taint with the pure power of Earth. For the duration of the spell, the target(s) gain a +5k5 bonus to all rolls made to resist gaining the Shadowlands Taint, and any Maho spells suffer a +10 TN penalty to affect them. This bonus does not apply to any rolls made to resist an increase in Taint the target already possesses – it only applies to new Taint gained from outside sources. Likewise it cannot protect the target from gaining Taint by casting Maho.
THE WOLF’S MERCY    3    EARTH    50'    One target creature    10 rounds    This spell has existed in Rokugan for centuries, but is best known for its extensive use by Toturi Sezaru, “the Wolf,” who employed it during his hunts for Bloodspeakers. It calls on the power of the Earth to affl ict the target, weighing down his body and impeding his muscles, leaving him weak and vulnerable. The target’s Earth Ring is lowered by 1 Rank, and his Wound Ranks are reduced correspondingly for the duration of the spell. (This can potentially kill him immediately if he has already suffered Wounds.) In addition, his Strength Rank is also lowered by 1 for the same duration. If the target has at least one full Rank of Shadowlands Taint, the Earth spirits will be fi lled with wrath, and punish him more severely, lowering his Earth Ring by 2 Ranks (to a minimum of 1).
ARMOR OF THE EMPEROR    4    EARTH    Personal    Self    5 Rounds    This spell covers the caster in a thick layer of tough, resilient Earth spirits who repel all damage, whether physical blows or magical effects. Any time the caster suffers damage from an enemy physical or magical attack, each individual damage die has its total Reduced by the caster’s Shugenja School Rank. This cannot reduce a die’s total below 0.
ESSENCE OF EARTH    4    EARTH    Personal or 20'    One target creature (self or another)    10 rounds    This spell infuses the target with the true strength of Earth, allowing him to shrug off blows which might otherwise take his life. For the duration of the spell, the target’s Earth Ring is considered to be 1 Rank higher, and his Wounds are increased correspondingly. However, when the spell ends, the Earth spirits immediately depart and the target’s Wounds return to normal – possibly resulting in death, if he has suffered sufficient injury.
SYMBOL OF EARTH    4    EARTH    Touch    Special    Permanent    Priests of the kami are capable of inscribing powerful wardsthat invoke the power of the elements against all who attempt to pass them. A symbol of Earth can be inscribed on a solid object, most often a door, window, gate, or any other passageway. Anyone attempting to pass through this passageway or otherwise pass by the ward is affected by its power, and must succeed at a Contested Roll using their Air against the caster’s Earth. Those who fail are struck with a powerful shockwave, and must succeed at a Strength roll against the total of the Spell Casting Roll used to create the ward or be knocked Prone and Stunned. If they have at least one Rank of Taint, they also suffer 2k2 Wounds. You may only have one Symbol of Earth in existence at any time, and Symbol spells of different elements may never affect the same area. This spell may be dispelled by another casting of Symbol of Earth from any shugenja, or by destroying the surface where the Symbol was etched.
TOMB OF THE JADE    4    EARTH    50'    One target creature    Concentration    Considered by many shugenja to be the ultimate spell for opposing the creatures of the Shadowlands, this spell calls on the purest of Earth spirits, those of jade, to consume the very Taint within the target. The spell can only affect a target who has at least one full Rank of Shadowlands Taint, but if the spell fails, the caster will not automatically know that the target is Taint-free – there is always the possibility that the target was able to resist the spell. When Tomb of Jade is cast, the target is momentarily immobilized as the Earth spirits enter his body. Each round, starting with the fi rst round, the caster must make a Contested Earth roll against the target. If the target wins, the spell ends. If the caster wins, the target takes 2k2 Wounds as the spirits begin to transform his body into jade. This continues each round until the target successfully resists, the caster stops concentrating, or the target dies. Those killed by this spell are transformed into statues of pure jade, which crumbles away into mundane dust in 24 hours.
WALL OF EARTH    4    EARTH    100'    Wall measuring a maximum of 10' high and 100' wide    10 minutes    This spell coaxes the spirits of Earth into rising up and forming a thick, powerful barrier to protect the caster. The wall of rock-hard earth which this spell creates can be shaped as the caster desires, and can be curved, placed on the side of a hill, or even formed in a circle. It is extremely tough, requiring a Strength roll against a TN of the caster’s (Earth + School Rank) x 5 in order to break through. It is strong enough to hold back a raging fl ood, a lava fl ow, or hurricane winds, at least as long as the spell lasts. When the spell expires, however, the earthen barrier crumbles away in moments.
EARTHQUAKE    5    EARTH    Personal    1 mile radius    1 minute    This spell unleashes a terrible, ground-wracking earthquake, centered on the caster, who alone is unaffected. The earthquake utterly destroys all wooden buildings within the radius of effect, and infl icts severe damage on stone structures. All persons within the area of the earthquake are thrown to the ground, and remain Prone and Stunned for the duration of the spell, as well as suffering 2k1 Wounds. Individuals who are inside buildings (including the caster) will suffer 6k6 damage from falling debris, collapsing roofs, etc. Casting this spell within range of a major inhabited area is generally considered an act of war.
MAJOR BINDING    5    EARTH    100'    One target Shadowlands creature    12 hours    The more powerful counterpart to the Kuni family’s Minor Binding spell, this spell has also been employed by other clan shugenja, especially those of the Phoenix Clan. It is used to imprison more powerful Shadowlands creatures and members of the Lost, typically for purposes of interrogation. Any Lost and any Shadowlands creature can be targeted with this spell. It can also target other spirit creatures who are Tainted. It cannot affect any other creatures. The spell is a ritual, and requires ten minutes to cast (making it quite hazardous when dealing with a rampaging oni), but if additional shugenja join in casting the spell the casting time is reduced by 1 minute per shugenja, to a minimum of 1 minute. If it is cast successfully, the casters make a Contested Roll of their combined Earth Rings against the Earth of the target. If the casters win, the spell calls forth manacles of pure elemental jade, which imprison the creature and render it helpless with the pain of its searing bonds for the duration of the spell. When the spell expires, however, the manacles instantly crumble into dust, and the creature is liable to seek immediate and bloody vengeance on its captors.
STRIKE AT THE ROOTS    5    EARTH    50'    One target creature    3 rounds    A more powerful and devastating form of The Wolf’s Mercy, this spell brings the true wrath of the Earth onto the target, draining all favor of the Earth from his body and leaving him a weak, trembling, helpless victim. After casting this spell, the caster must succeed in a Contested Earth roll against the targets of the spell (rolling separately if he is targeting multiple people). If the target loses the roll, his Earth Ring is immediately reduced to 1 for the duration of the spell. This also reduces his Wound Ranks and may result in his immediate death if he has already suffered injuries.
THE KAMI'S STRENGTH    5    EARTH    30'    One target creature    5 rounds    This spell allows the caster to fortify one person with the power of Earth, greatly enhancing their physical capabilities and their resistance to damage. The target of this spell gains Reduction of 20 and increases his Strength and one other physical Trait by an amount equal to the caster’s Earth Ring. In return, however, the target is weighed down by the burden of Earth and cannot take Simple Move Actions (he can still take a Free Move Action).
THE KAMI'S WILL    5    EARTH    30'    One target creature    10 rounds    The counterpoint to The Kami’s Strength, this spell infuses one person with the stubbornness and determination of Earth, greatly enhancing their willpower and making them all but immune to the effects of elemental magic. The target of this spell increases his Willpower by an amount equal to the caster’s Earth Ring, and any spells (friendly or hostile, but not including Maho spells) which target him suffer a penalty of –XkX to their Spell Casting roll, where X is the caster’s Earth Ring. In return, however, the target is made so stubborn and willful that he cannot function properly in a social environment, and suffers a penalty to all Social Skill rolls of –Xk0, where X is the Earth Ring of the caster.
ESSENCE OF JADE    6    EARTH    30'    One target creature    10 rounds    This spell calls on the purity of jade to protect its targets against the power of Jigoku, whether manifested as Taint or as the dreaded magic known as maho. The target radiates the sacred green light of jade, and while the spell lasts, he cannot gain the Shadowlands Taint and is completely immune to the effects of all maho spells. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who possesses at least one full Rank of Taint, for the pure jade spirits will recoil from such a corrupt individual, immediately alerting the caster to this individual’s Tainted nature.
POWER OF THE EARTH DRAGON    6    EARTH    50'    One target creature    10 minutes    This spell is the most powerful of the physically protective Earth spells, calling on the favor of the Dragon of Earth to enshroud the targets with protection against all forms of harm. The Earth spirits absorb all damage which the targets suffer while the spell lasts. However, there are limits to even Earth’s endurance. Nemuranai can bypass the protection. Further, if the Earth spirits protecting a specifi c target absorb a total of 100 Wounds of damage, they will be exhausted and the spell’s effects on that target come to an end.
PRISON OF EARTH    6    EARTH    30'    One target creature    Permanent    The most powerful of the binding spells which Earth shugenja use to deal with dangerous creatures, this spell can literally imprison the essence of such a creature for as long as the caster desires. Casting this spell requires that the caster possess a gem or pearl in which to imprison the creature (the GM may, discretionally, allow other rare or precious items to be used, such as a beautifully inlaid puzzle-box or a crystal pendant). The spell can target any creature native to the realms of Jigoku, Gaki-Do, or Toshigoku, and any other non-human creature with at least 1 full Rank of Taint. After casting the spell, the caster must make a Contested Willpower roll against the target. If the caster wins, the creature’s physical body vanishes and its essence is imprisoned within the item. It will remain there indefi nitely unless the item is physically destroyed. If that happens, the released creature immediately resumes its physical form, and will most likely seek vengeance against the caster or his descendants.
RISE, EARTH    6    EARTH    30'    One summoned spirit    Concentration    The Earth itself arises and takes form to defend you. The ultimate realization of the Summon spell, this prayer summons a massive kami of pure Earth to serve you. It takes the form of a vaguely humanoid shape, roughly ten feet in height, with abroad body and thick limbs all formed from earth and stone. This mighty Earth kami may move up to 5 x your Earth per round, and its footsteps shake the earth in a twenty foot radius around it, preventing anyone from making Simple Move Actions within its area of effect. This Earth spirit is treated as if it has all Physical Traits equal to your Earth Ring, and attacks with a Jiujitsu Skill Rank equal to half your Earth Rank. The DR from these attacks is equal to your Earth Ring. The kami can carry up to 1,000 pounds of weight if so commanded, and its blows are strong enough to destroy any wooden structure and to shatter stone walls of one-foot thickness. For purposes of taking damage, the spirit is considered to have Wounds as though it were a human with Earth equal to your Earth Ring, but suffers no Wound penalties. It is Invulnerable (see the creature rules in the Book of Void for details of this ability). If it is successfully reduced to zero Wounds, it is dispelled.
BITING STEEL    1    FIRE    Touch    1 bladed weapon    1 minute    Fire spirits can infuse metal with their own fury, turning a sharp edge into a supremely perfect one. This spell enhances the damage of steel bladed weapons, such as swords, knives, naginata, etc. Biting Steel cannot affect weapons which are not metal blades, which are nemuranai, or which have al- ready been enhanced by magical effects. The meleeWeapon’s DR is increased by 1k1 for the duration of the spell.
BURNING KISS OF STEEL    1    FIRE    Touch    One melee weapon in caster's hand    5 minutes    This spell embraces a weapon with fire, causing it to be larger and more effective. When the spell is cast, a tendril of fire extends from your hands to engulf your weapon. (If you drop or lose the weapon, the spell effect ends.) This weapon gains a +1k1 bonus to melee attack rolls. The bonus is +2k2 when making attacks against mounted opponents or opponents of larger than human size.
ENVIOUS FLAMES    1    FIRE    30'    One target    Instantaneous    Fire’s most basic power is destruction, and summoned Fire spirits can easily be unleashed on one’s enemies. This spell invokes a single Fire kami, which lances toward the target, hitting unerringly so long as the target is within range. The spell deals 2k2 Wounds. The burns this spell infl icts are quite painful, and if the spell targets a shugenja who is casting a spell, his Willpower roll has a TN of 20 plus the damage dealt, instead of the normal 10 plus damage dealt.
EXTINGUISH    1    FIRE    Personal    100' radius    Instantaneous    Fire spirits can be driven away by the proper invocation, a very useful ability in Rokugani towns and cities where the construction is all wood and paper. This spell dismisses the active Fire kami in the area. All non-magical fi re in the area of effect is immediately snuffed out, and any damage dealt by fire (magical or not) reduces its DR by 1k1 until the start of the next Round.
FIRES OF PURITY    1    FIRE    25'    One target    1 minute    This spell, one of the few directly protective prayers involving the Fire kami, asks the kami to protect one person, enveloping the target in a shroud of bright flames. Neither the target nor anything he carries takes damage from the spell, but anyone who comes into contact with him or strikes him with a melee attack takes 2k2 Wounds. Anyone the target strikes in melee with an unarmed attack or a weapon he carried when the spell was cast also takes an extra 2k2 Wounds. Anything the target puts down, however, cannot be picked back up without subjecting it to the damage from the spell. Ranged weapons such as arrows bypass this barrier of fire, dealing Wounds as normal.
THE FIRES THAT CLEANSE    1    FIRE    Self    30' radius    Instantaneous    Destruction is one of the basic impulses of Fire, and this spell calls on that urge to spread destruction in the caster’s surroundings. The spell whips the kami into a frenetic chaos, destroying everything around you. Everyone in the area of effect, including you, suffers damage with DR equal to your Fire Ring. This result is rolled once and applied to everyone within the area – however, you take only half damage (rounded up), since the kami do make some effort to avoid you.
FURY OF OSANO-WO    1    FIRE    300'    One target    Instantaneous    This spell is actually a prayer to the Fortune of Fire and Thunder, inviting his wrath upon your enemy. It can only be cast outdoors, and summons a bolt of lightning from the sky, striking the target for 5k2 Wounds. Everyone within 10’ of the target must make a Stamina roll versus a TN of 15 to avoid being deafened for 2 Rounds. If this spell is cast during a thunderstorm, the damage is increased to 6k2 for a moderate storm and 6k3 for a disastrous storm or hurricane.
KATANA OF FIRE    1    FIRE    Personal or 20'    One created weapon    5 minutes    You summon a blade of pure fi re, blazing like the soul of an honorable warrior. The weapon’s default form is a katana, but one Raise can change its form to any other sword of your choosing. The katana has a DR of 2k2. When wielding this weapon, you may use your School Rank in place of your Kenjutsu Skill if you wish. If you do possess the Kenjutsu Skill, you add your Honor Rank to all damage rolls made with this weapon. The katana of fi re disappears if it is lost from your hand. Instead of summoning the katana for yourself, you may cause it to appear in the hands of an ally within 20 feet. He is treated as the caster for all purposes of the spell, but does not gain the Honor boost to damage.
NEVER ALONE    1    FIRE    Touch    One target    5 Rounds    This spell invokes Fire’s element of knowledge and understanding, strengthening the spirit of one of your allies by opening his eyes to the courage of his ancestors. The target of the spell receives a bonus to all attack rolls, Skill rolls, and Trait Rolls equal to your Fire Ring. This effect lasts until either the spell expires, or until the target fails an attack roll or Skill Roll, or until the target suffers Wounds from any source, whichever comes fi rst.
THE RAGING FORGE    1    FIRE    Touch    One weapon or armor    Instantaneous    Fire is the element of creation as well as destruction, and a skilled shugenja can use this to great effect. This spell invokes the powers of the forge, mighty and merciless, to remake a material item, such as a weapon or suit of armor, into its perfect form. The target item loses all blemishes, including cracks or nicks. This spell cannot repair an item which has actually been broken or destroyed, however, and it can only affect items that are of ordinary quality.
DISRUPT THE AURA    2    FIRE    50'    Target person or creature    24 hours    Anyone whose elements are out of balance will feel the effects, and this spell creates this condition deliberately by aggravating the Fire present in the target’s body. While the spell is in effect, the target cannot be healed by magical means. Magical spells, items, or Techniques that attempt to restore Wounds to the target automatically fail. (Mundane wound treatment with the Medicine skill will still be effective.) The target may realize something is physically wrong with him but cannot fi nd out what is happening without the help of a shugenja – casting Sense (Fire) will show the presence of many excited Fire spirits within the target.
ENTICING DANCE OF THE FLAME    2    FIRE    50'    20' radius    2 rounds    Anyone whose elements are out of balance will feel the effects, and this spell creates this condition deliberately by aggravating the Fire present in the target’s body. While the spell is in effect, the target cannot be healed by magical means. Magical spells, items, or Techniques that attempt to restore Wounds to the target automatically fail. (Mundane wound treatment with the Medicine skill will still be effective.) The target may realize something is physically wrong with him but cannot fi nd out what is happening without the help of a shugenja – casting Sense (Fire) will show the presence of many excited Fire spirits within the target.
THE FIRES FROM WITHIN    2    FIRE    100'    One target    Instantaneous    Probably the most widely known and recognized offensive spell in the element of Fire, this prayer has been in use by Rokugani shugenja since the very earliest days of the Empire. You summon Fire kami to form an orb of fl ame that hovers in your palm for a moment before streaking toward the target. The sphere gains momentum and size until it hits its target, making it quite spectacular visually. The spell has a DR equal to your Fire Ring.
HURRIED STEPS    2    FIRE    Personal    Self    2 rounds    Fire is the element of thought, and thought is swift indeed. You draw upon the speed of the Fire kami to aid you in the next spell you cast. The casting time of the next Fire spell you cast is reduced by 4 Rounds. If the next spell is Mastery Level 3 or lower, it casts instantaneously as a Simple Action. If you do not begin casting the new spell within the next 2 Rounds, however, the benefi t of Hurried Steps elapses.
MENTAL QUICKNESS    2    FIRE    Touch    One item    10 minutes    Fire kami can be imbued into physical objects, allowing them to remain present for longer periods of time. Shugenja have devised many ways to use this technique to aid themselves and others. This spell, one of the most basic of this kind, imbues a material item with the cleverness and wit of fi re. Anyone who carries that item has their Intelligence Trait increased by 3 for the duration of the spell.
RELENTLESS HEAT    2    FIRE    Touch    One armor    10 Rounds    This spell is designed to protect bushi by infusing a Fire kami into their armor. The spell targets one suit of armor, which glows with the strength of the merciless desert sun. Any opponent who attempts to strike the person wearing the armor, whether or not the attack hits, is immediately considered to be Fatigued until the beginning of their next Turn. The penalties apply to the attack roll that triggered the spell, and any attackers in the Full Attack Posture immediately assume the Attack Posture instead. This spell has no effect on ranged attacks or spells that target the wearer of the armor.
TAIL OF THE FIRE DRAGON    2    FIRE    Personal    Self    4 Rounds    This spell invokes several Fire kami to form a whip-like tendril that extends from the caster’s hand. The tendril of flame will not burn you, since the kami are grateful for the opportunity to burn others at your command. You may use this tendril to strike enemies as far as 30’ away, extending it out and back with blinding speed. Your attack roll with the tendril is equal to your Agility + (twice your School Rank), keeping your Agility. The tendril has a DR equal to your Fire Ring.
WARD OF PURITY    2    FIRE    Touch    15' radius from the object touched    1 day    Although Earth is the traditional method of opposing evil forces like the Shadowlands Taint, the spirits of Fire can also be invoked to purge and destroy such spiritual abominations. This spell binds a Fire kami into a specifi c location which it protects against the forces of evil. Casting the spell requires inscribing elaborate kanji on a fl at surface in chalk or ink, and takes one minute of concentrated effort, after which the Spell Casting Roll must be made. Once the Ward of Purity is activated and the power of the kami is fully engaged, however,the kami within the inscription protects the area against the infl uence of the Shadowlands or the Lying Darkness. Persons or creatures with at least 1 Shadowlands Taint Rank, or who are under the control of the Lying Darkness, must make a successful Contested Willpower Roll against you in order to enter the Ward’s area of effect; you gain a +5 bonus to this roll. In addition, those creatures who successfully enter the area suffer extreme pain, as the power of the ward burns their very essence. Their bodies ignite and they suffer Wounds equal to the total of your Fire Ring + Insight Rank each Round they remain within the area of effect. Spells and missiles are unaffected by Ward of Purity. The object upon which the ward is inscribed must remain immobile and the inscription must remain clearly visible at all times, or else the Ward is dispelled. If overlapping Wards of Purity are present, their effects do not stack.
BREATH OF THE FIRE DRAGON    3    FIRE    Personal    15' long, 5' wide blast    4 Rounds    This spell is a prayer to the Dragon of Fire, one of the mightiest of celestial beings, entreating him for a bit of his power. If the spell is successful, you gain the ability to breathe a bolt of fl ames from your open mouth once per Round as a Simple Action. The bolt has a DR equal to your Fire Ring and strikes every target in front of you within the area of effect. You may choose to take actions other than breathing fi re while under the effects of this spell, but you cannot speak or cast spells. The spell expires after four Rounds, but you may choose to end this spell during the Reactions Stage of any earlier Round.
FIERY WRATH    3    FIRE    100'    One free- standing structure, or 50'x 50' area    Instantaneous    It was originally created to clear brush for farming and to demolish wooden structures with a minimum of workand no hazard; it is also used to start bonfi res for rituals and celebrations. The spell allows you to destroy a building or other structure by appealing to the excitable Fire kami within the target’s materials. All fl ammable materials within the area of effect immediately catch fi re and burn until nothing but ash is left. The fi re cannot be extinguished except by magical means; mundane water, sand, and other retardants will have no effect. Only one structure may be targeted by the spell, and the fire will not spread out to adjoining structures, as your prayers keep the Fire kami under tight control. Living beings and materials that are not fl ammable are not affected; in fact, while clothes worn by people caught within the area of effect will burn, their fl esh will not so much as singe.
THE FIST OF OSANO-WO    3    FIRE    50'    20' radius    1 round    A more powerful prayer to the Fortune of Thunder, this spell invokes his anger to devastate a targeted area. Massive lightning strikes and vaguely fi st-shaped bolts of flame streak from the skies, smiting the area of effect. Weak structures and those easily set on fi re (such as most Rokugani homes) are destroyed by the spell’s fury, or catch fire and are consumed. The spell has a DR equal to your Fire Ring, infl icting this damage on anyone caught within the area of effect. Using this spell in populated areas is generally considered a criminal act, unless the shugenja can cite extreme circumstances, since fires are terribly dangerous to Rokugani cities.
HAZE OF BATTLE    3    FIRE    10'    One target    5 rounds, or 1 hour out of combat    Fire spirits are known for their erratic and temperamental nature, and shugenja can badly disrupt their foes in battle by imbuing them with this aspect of the element. The target of this spell is filled with the unfocused fury of Fire, enraging him and forcing him to lose perspective. The target immediately assumes the Full Attack Stance and cannot switch from that Stance for the duration of the spell. If the spell is cast out of battle, the target gains the Brash and Contrary Disadvantages for the duration of the spell. This spell’s effects can be overcome by those of strong will. The target can attempt to resist with an opposed Willpower roll, but you add your Fire to the total of your roll. If the spell is cast in battle, this roll occurs during the Reactions Stage (and may be attempted each Round). If the spell is cast out of battle, the roll occurs once every 10 minutes.
HUNGRY BLADE    3    FIRE    50'    One weapon    5 rounds    This spell is a more potent version of Biting Steel, designed to enhance any weapon rather than merely a sword. The spell strengthens the Fire spirits in a single target weapon, causing them to come forth and form a faint sheath of fi re around it. The weapon’s wielder adds +1k0 to all attack rolls, and all of his damage dice explode on a result of 8 or better. Each die can explode on an 8 or 9 only once per roll, however, even if the wielder has other effects that allow the die to explode on 9s.
RAVENOUS SWARMS    3    FIRE    30'    One target person    5 Rounds    A more powerful and sophisticated form of the prayer which invokes the Fires From Within, this spell not only damages the target but also disrupts his own attempts to invoke the Fire kami, making it a very effective weapon against a rival Fire shugenja. You summon forth a bolt of fl ames that streaks toward the target with wild abandon. The fl ames deal 4k3 Wounds on impact and then encircle the opponent for the duration of the spell, waiting for him to make a mistake. If the target casts any Fire spell during that time, the Fire kami instantly strike, dealing 3k3 extra Wounds and causing the Spell Casting Roll to automatically fail. (The target loses the appropriate spell slot as usual.)
SHINING LIGHT    3    FIRE    30'    One target armor    10 Rounds    Another example of spells which can imbue Fire kami into items, this spell temporarily binds a Fire kami into a piece of armor (such as a helmet or chest plate). The armor emits a bright light that becomes blinding whenever the wearer is attacked. Any time the armor’s wearer is attacked in melee, immediately afterward the opponent takes 2k2 Wounds and is Blinded until the Reactions Stage of the same Round. The spell has no effect on ranged attacks.
DEATH OF FLAME    4    FIRE    100'    One target    5 Rounds    This spell brings the anger of Fire on the target, suppressing his elemental Fire and lowering both his Agility and his Intelligence Ranks by an amount equal to your Fire Ring, to a minimum of one. If you maintain Concentration for the duration of the spell’s effect, the target cannot escape its effects. If you do not maintain Concentration, each Round at the start of his Turn the target may make a contested Fire roll against you (using his original, unmodifi ed Fire Ring) to end the spell’s effect.
DEFENSE OF FIRESTORM    4    FIRE    Touch    One target armor    5 Rounds    A more potent form of spells like Shining Light, this prayer summons forth an aura of magical fl ames from a suit of armor, surrounding and protecting the armor’s wearer. These flames do not harm the armor’s bearer and do not harm living things. However, all wooden weapons (including arrows and many polearms) burn instantly before they reach the target, doing no damage. The fl ames also impede sight to the target, increasing his Armor TN by 20.
THE MENDING FORGE    4    FIRE    Touch    One target item    Instantaneous    This simple and powerful spell has only one function: to call on the creative power of Fire to bring back what has been destroyed. Any damaged or destroyed material item can be restored with this spell, provided all of its pieces are gathered in front of the caster. (If some pieces are missing, the spell will automatically fail.) The spell takes 1 minute to cast, and you must concentrate during that minute. If successful, the spell restores the item to a whole and undamaged state. It should be noted that the Fire kami must work harder to repair items of unusual quality – if you use this spell to repair a nemuranai or an item of Fine quality or better, you must offer the Fire kami a gift (another item for them to burn and destroy) appropriate to the worth of the item.
SYMBOL OF FIRE    4    FIRE    100'    10' radius    Permanent    Priests of the kami are capable of inscribing powerful wards that invoke the power of the elements against all who attempt to pass them. A symbol of Fire can be inscribed on a solid object, most often a door, window, gate, or any other passageway. Anyone attempting to pass through this passageway or otherwise pass by the ward is affected by its power, and must succeed at a Contested Roll using their Water against the caster’s Fire. Those who fail are Dazed, Blinded for one Round, and take 3k3 Wounds. This spell may be dispelled by another casting of Symbol of Fire from any shugenja, or by destroying the surface where the Symbol was etched. You may only have one Symbol of Fire in existence at any time, and Symbol spells of different elements may never affect the same area.
WALL OF FIRE    4    FIRE    100'    Special    1 hour    You invoke the Fire kami to spring up and form a wall of flames, barring passage to all. The wall is a 10’ tall, 1’ wide,and 25’ long, and causes 6k6 Wounds to anyone who touches it. This wall may be made shorter or thinner as desired, within the total specifi cations, but all of the mass of flames mustbe used somehow. The wall may be created in an area where people or creatures are standing, forcing them to make a Reflexes Trait Roll against a TN of 20 to avoid taking Woundsfrom the fire. You may Raise to increase one of the specifi cations (height, width, or length) by its base increment (10’, 1’, or 25’ respectively).
WARD OF THUNDER    4    FIRE    Touch    15' radius from the armor    1 hour    Osano-Wo’s protection can be temporarily invoked for a suit of armor by casting this spell and inscribing the kanji for thunder on the armor. Those within 15’ of the armor are under Osano-Wo’s care, and are completely protected from nonmagical fire and thunder for the duration of the spell. Additionally, any Fire spell cast by a shugenja other than yourself which targets something within the area of effect has its Spell Casting TN increased by 20.
DESTRUCTIVE WAVE    5    FIRE    Personal    25' radius    Instantaneous    A highly potent offensive spell, originally devised by the Isawa Elemental Masters, this prayer summons up a great mass of Fire kami, which roll outward from the caster in a wave of searing flames. Every target within the area of effect, whether friendly or hostile, takes 7k7 Wounds, for the raging flames make no distinction between ally and enemy. You alone do not take damage from the spell.
EVERBURNING RAGE    5    FIRE    25'    One target    1 Round    A powerful curse that infuses the target’s body with angry Fire spirits, wracking him with pain as the kami sear his nerves and ligaments. For the duration of the spell, the victim is considered to be at the Down Wound Level and suffers all associated penalties and conditions, although he takes no actual Wounds from the spell. When the spell expires, the pain instantly ceases and the target may stand up as if nothing had happened. This spell is somewhat controversial with some shugenja schools, particularly the more peaceful ones, since it amounts to little more than the deliberate infl iction of pain. A few shugenja have even noted certain disturbing similarities between this spell’s effects and those of certain maho curses.
FOLLOW THE FLAME    5    FIRE    Personal    Details in Description    5 Rounds    This spell grants you exceptional control of the nearby Fire kami, allowing you to coax them into a very unusual and terrifying attack. On the Round this spell is cast and every Round thereafter, you may declare a line of sight target within 300’ and send a stream of fire toward it that snakes along the ground. (On later Rounds, designating a target in this manner is a Simple Action.) The stream of fire moves at a rate of 75’ each Round and moves around impassable (or inflammable) barriers in order to reach its target. Once the fi re reaches its destination, the target bursts into flames, suffering 6k5 Wounds. The subject catches fire and takes half that many Wounds (rounded down) every subsequent Round until the fire is doused normally or the spell’s duration expires.
LIGHT OF THE SUN    5    FIRE    100'    30' radius    10 Rounds    This prayer invokes the power of the Sun, worshipped and venerated throughout Rokugan, and is an especial favorite among the Moshi family, although shugenja all across the Empire have learned it. The spell calls down a concentrated beam of pure sunlight to punish the unworthy. Everyone caught in the area of effect takes 2k2 Wounds per Round from the intense heat. Human targets (only) take an additional 2k1 Wounds for every Honor Rank they are below 4, and an additional2k2 Wounds if they possess at least 1 Rank of the Shadowlands Taint or are controlled by the Lying Darkness. Human targets who have an Honor Rank of 0 are Blinded for a number of Rounds equal to your Fire Ring.
WINGS OF THE PHOENIX    5    FIRE    Personal    Self    10 Rounds    The Phoenix is one of the most powerful symbols of Fire known to the Rokugani, and this spell calls on the essence of that being to grant its caster the power of flight. When this spell is cast, you summon clouds of Fire kami who take the form of giant wings sprouting from your back. You gain the ability to fly for the duration of the spell, moving at a speed of Water x 10 for a Free Action or Water x 20 for a Simple Action. If you are airborne when the spell expires, the Fire kami will bear you down to earth before departing.
BEAM OF THE INFERNO    6    FIRE    200'    One target    Instantaneous    This is perhaps the deadliest single spell available to a shugenja, and one of the most fearsome spells ever developed in the Empire. The prayer invokes a tremendous blast of fire against the chosen target, who takes 10k10 Wounds. The spell puts all the Fire kami in the area into a state of agitation, and normal fires within range will burn hotter and more violently for many minutes after this spell is cast.
GLOBE OF THE EVERLASTING SUN    6    FIRE    500'    1 mile    1 day    This mighty prayer calls on all the Fire kami in the area to remain quiet and calm, soothing the agitation which so often afflicts them. It is often invoked during major festivals, such as the crowning of a new Emperor. For the duration of the spell, all buildings within the area of effect are immune to the effects of magical fi re, and all Fire spells cast within that area have the TN of their Spell Casting Rolls increased by 15. Normal fires will still ignite and burn, but they do so sluggishly, and do not spread easily.
THE SOUL'S BLADE    6    FIRE    Touch    One target weapon    5 Rounds    This spell imbues incredibly powerful Fire kami into a weapon, granting it the full fury of a raging firestorm. A bushi armed with this weapon is a terrible opponent, for the Fire spirits shock and daze his enemies with every blow. For the duration of the spell, the weapon will overcome Invulnerability, and every target hit with it is automatically Stunned.
BO OF WATER    1    WATER    Personal or 20'    One created weapon    5 minutes    You summon a staff of pure water, as rigid as the real thing despite its fluid nature. The melee Weapon’s default form is a bo, but one Raise can change its form to any other staff of your choosing. The meleeWeapon has DR 1k2. If you do not possess the Staves Skill, you may instead use your School Rank in its place. If you do possess the Staves Skill, using this meleeWeapon grants you one Free Raise that can only be used on the Knockdown Maneuver. This meleeWeapon disappears if it is lost from your hand. Instead of summoning the bo for yourself, you may cause it to appear in the hands of an ally within 20 feet. He is treated as the caster for all purposes of the spell, but he does not gain the Free Raise bonus.
CLARITY OF PURPOSE    1    WATER    Personal    10' radius around the caster    2 rounds    One of the many strengths of water is in its speed. All allies within the area of effect of this spell gain a bonus of +5 to their Initiative Scores for the duration of the spell.
EBBING STRENGTH    1    WATER    20'    One target creature    3 rounds    Energy fl ows through the universe just as water flows through the mortal shell. You may send your energy to another, weakening yourself and strengthening them in the process. You may reduce any one of your Physical Traits by an amount up to your School Rank. The target of this spell increases the same Physical Trait by the same amount. If your Trait is reduced to 0 as a result of this spell, you immediately fall unconscious and the spell’s duration is reduced to 1 round. No Trait may be enhanced above double its normal rank by this spell.
PATH TO INNER PEACE    1    WATER    Touch    One target individual    Instantaneous    The water kami can infl uence the flow of water through the body, dramatically hastening the natural healing process. You can use this spell to heal Wounds that another individual has suffered. This spell restores a number of Wounds to the target equal to the amount by which the Spell Casting Roll exceededthe spell’s TN to cast.
REFLECTIONS OF PAN KU    1    WATER    Touch    One object    Instantaneous    Divining the abilities of an object is among the simplest lessons a student of water learns in the temple. If this spell is successfully cast on an object, you automatically learn all powers and abilities that object possesses. This is most frequently used to identify any supernatural qualities an item possesses, such as a nemuranai or a cursed weapon, but it can also identify the spell contained within a shugenja’s prayer scroll. This spell will not allow a shugenja to read a scroll if it is written in a cipher he does not understand, but he can at least identify the spell in question. This spell will also grant the caster knowledge of the item’s origin in very broad strokes, such as where it was forged, the Clan of the individual who has carried it the longest, or something similar at the GM’s discretion.
REVERSAL OF FORTUNES    1    WATER    10'    One target indivudual    3 rounds    Versatility is the domain of water, and those who carry its blessing reap the rewards. For the duration of this spell, the target may immediately re-roll any one roll per round. This must be done immediately after the first roll is completed, and the target may keep either result.
THE RUSHING WAVE    1    WATER    10'    One target individual    1 round    You can temporarily increase the speed of your target. This spell allows the target to make a Free Move Action of up hisWater Ring x 10’ (instead of the normal x 5’). Without Raisesfor Duration, this benefi t must be used on the target’s nextTurn or it is lost.
SPEED OF THE WATER FALL    1    WATER    Touch    One target individual or creature    1 hour    Those filled with the essence of water find their movement far faster than ever before. The target of this spell may move a total distance per round equal to their Water x 20’ plus an amount equal to twice your Water Ring. This spell does not grant the target additional movement, it simply increases the maximum possible amount they can move during a Round for the duration of the spell.
SPIRIT OF THE WATER    1    WATER    20'    One target individual    Instantaneous    The spirit of water is both fluid and rapid. The target gains one additional Simple Action during the Reactions Stage of the Round in which this spell is completed. This Action cannot be used to make an attack.
SYMPATHETIC ENERGIES    1    WATER    25'    One target individual    Instantaneous    Energy flows between all living things as water flows throughthe earth. You may transfer any one existing spell effect from you to the willing target of this spell. With three Raises, you may transfer one spell effect from one willing target to another willing target. You cannot transfer spells between unwilling targets.
CLOAK OF THE MIYA    2    WATER    Personal    Self    5 rounds    You wrap yourself in the protective embrace of the wave. Your Armor TN is increased by an amount equal to your Water Ring plus your School Rank for the duration of this spell.
INARI'S BLESSING    2    WATER    Created sustenance    Personal    Instantaneous    Inari is the Fortune of Rice, and one of the most beloved of all divine entities throughout the Empire. This spell invokes Inari’s blessing, and creates nourishing food and drink at your command. This spell generates enough food and drink to sustain a number of individuals equal to your School Rank +1 for one day. Without Raises, this food is bland but sustaining, such as unflavored rice and water, but with Raises, you canincrease the quality of the food to seafood or tea at the GM’s discretion. The TN to cast this spell is doubled when in the Shadowlands.
REFLECTIVE POOL    2    WATER    10 miles    Body of water / target location    5 minutes    The inscrutable knowledge of water is a great boon to those who know the means by which it can be invoked. You may stare into a body of water, which may be as small as a puddle, and through it view a familiar location as if you were present, although you can only see what is taking place, not hear it. In order for a location to be familiar to you, you must either have spent a great deal of time there (your home, the dojo, a preferred temple, etc.), or have spent a minimum of ten minutes in meditation at the location. Any body of water can be used for this spell, but since the visions imparted are visual, images depicted will be clearer with larger bodies.
REJUVENATING VAPORS    2    WATER    Touch    One target individual    Instantaneous    Water washes away all that is impure, refreshing and reinvigorating all it touches. The target of this spell is instantly refreshed as if he had just arisen from a full night’s sleep. This does not restore spent Void Points, but can eliminate fatigue and exhaustion. When used on a shugenja, this spell does restore the spell slots associated with the Void Ring (which can be used for any elements), but not the spell slots associated with other Rings. Abilities that characters may use a limited number of times per day are not refreshed by this spell. No individual can benefi t from Rejuvenating Vapors more than once within a 24-hour period.
STAND AGAINST THE WAVES    2    WATER    10'    One target individual    Instantaneous    A samurai who possesses the speed and strength of the mighty river is a dangerous foe indeed. The target of this spell gains a Simple Action during the Reaction Stage of the current Combat Round. This action may only be used to make an attack. If the target is incapable of making an attack as a Simple Action, this spell grants him a Complex Action instead. This spell cannot award a shugenja the ability to cast a second spell in the same Round.
THE TIES THAT BIND    2    WATER    10 miles    Self    Instantaneous    Even the lightest touch forges a connection, and through the spirits of water that connection may be explored. This spell allows you to seek out the spirits of Water within a single, specific object. You must be familiar with the object in question, either having spent a great deal of time around it or handled it personally. If the object is within the range of this spell, you will know the direction and relative distance it is from your current position.
WAVE-BORNE SPEED    2    WATER    Personal    Self    2 Rounds    The speed of the river can be imparted by knowledgeable shugenja. Your Water Ring is increased by 2 for the purposes of determining how far you may move as part of any Move Actions made during the present Round or the following Round.
WISDOM & CLARITY    2    WATER    Personal    Self    1 hour    By entreating the insight of the Water kami, a shugenja may dramatically increase his ability to perceive the world around him. For the duration of this spell, your reading speed doubles, and you will have perfect recall of everything read while under the influence of this spell. This spell does not enhance comprehension, however, so any language or cipher you are not familiar with is still completely indecipherable.
NEAR TO ICE    3    WATER    Touch    One target individual    5 rounds    As water grows durable and resistant with the coming winter, so too can the water within the human form become sterner and more durable. The target of this spell has all current Wound Penalties negated for the duration of the spell. Any additional penalties incurred take full effect, using the difference between the negated penalty and the new penalty as the effective penalty incurred. Wounds are not healed by this effect, they simply cease to inhibit those suffering from them.
REGROW THE WOUND    3    WATER    Touch    One target individual    Concentration    Water flows into all things, and flows out. In flowing out, it can carry away that which is undesirable. The pain and suffering inflicted by injuries can be channeled away from an individual, and cast into the infi nite ocean where they are lost forever. The target of this spell recovers a number of Wounds equal to your Water Ring plus your School Rank each round the spell is in effect. You must touch the target when the spell is cast, but after that it may be maintained without physical contact.
SILENT WATERS    3    WATER    Personal    Self    Variable    The memory of the ocean is infinite, and its vast power can lay in wait for a very long time indeed. Upon completion of a successful casting of this spell, you may immediately cast a second spell of any element. This second spell must be a spell you can normally cast, and it must be of Mastery Level 3 or lower. If the second Spell Casting Roll is successful, the second spell is stored within you, and will not activate until a specific physical effect takes place, which you specify at the time of the casting. The spell’s trigger could be that you speak a certain word, draw a blade, or fall in battle, for example. Whatever the trigger, when it occurs, the second spell immediately takes effect as if you had just finished casting the spell. A character may never benefit from multiple uses of Silent Waters at one time. If a second use of the spell is cast on the same individual, the current “stored” spell is immediately dispelled and replaced with the new one.
STRIKE OF THE TSUNAMI    3    WATER    25'    A cone originating drom the caster, 10' wide at the end    Instantaneous    Water is everywhere, and obeys the commands of its favored shugenja. You summon a crushing wave of water that overruns everything in its path. The wave infl icts 3k3 Wounds on everything within the affected area, and all opponents within the area of effect must make an Earth Roll (TN 15) or suffer Knockdown. Obviously, everything within the area of effect is saturated with water.
VISION OF THE FUTURE    3    WATER    Personal    Self    1 minute    Although not as reliable as the natural gift of foresight or the (equally rare) Void spells that enable divination, this spell still allows powerful visions of the future. It was first developed by the Tonbo family of the Dragonfly Clan, and is found infrequently outside theirranks. The spell requires use of a large pool of still water into which you must gaze. Upon completion of the spell, you enter a brief trance, and see images of things that have not yet come to pass. These images are rarely direct, and tend to be symbolic (violence is depicted as a scene of battle, for instance), but the events foreseen are completely accurate, and will come to pass unless prevented by your direct intervention. Only the shugenja casting this spell may see the events depicted in the vision. Many shugenja believe that use of this spell is a means of thwarting the natural order, and regard both it and those who make use of it negatively.
WALKING UPON THE WAVES    3    WATER    Touch    One target individual    10 minutes    The Water kami buoy those who carry their favor and grant them passage. The target of this spell may move across the surface of water as if it were solid ground (Basic Terrain). If the surface of the water is disturbed, as by a storm, rolling waves, or any other similar event, it counts as Difficult Terrain.
WATER KAMI'S BLESSING    3    WATER    Touch    One target individual (may be the caster)    5 rounds    By calling upon the clarity of water, you can receive tremendous insight into the world around you. The target of this spell receives a bonus to all his Perception based rolls, whether Trait Rolls, Skill Rolls, or anything else, consisting of additional rolled dice equal to your Water Ring.
DOMINION OF SUITENGU    4    WATER    100 miles    Two bodies of water    Concentration    The Fortune of the Sea is a wrathful entity, but one who nevertheless blesses those who entreat him properly. This spell, created by the Mantis clan, allows you to peer into a body of water, which must be at least one foot across and one inch deep, and see out of any other body of water anywhere in the Empire, so long as it is within range of the spell. This can be at any point along the seacoast, a lake, river, stream, or even a puddle, but you must know the location of the body of water you are targeting. You can see everything around that body of water as if you were submerged within it. You cannot hear what is taking place, only see it.
EBB & FLOW OF BATTLE    4    WATER    Personal    All selected allies within 50' radius of the caster    5 rounds    Mobility is one of the greatest strengths of Water. In a skirmish or a battle, mobility is key to survival. This spell increases the movement speed of all allies within range. You may choose to exclude specifi c allies from its effects if you choose. All those affected by the spell may move a distance equal to their Water Ring x 10 in feet as a Free Action (this is normally a Simple Action).
HEART OF THE WATER DRAGON    4    WATER    25'    Target individuals equal to caster's School Rank (may include the caster)    1 round per School Rank    The Water Dragon is a benevolent entity, and his blessings are powerful. Any time that a target of this spell suffers damage during the duration, he instantly regains 1k1 Wounds.
THE PATH NOT TAKEN    4    WATER    Personal    Self    1 day    No element can match the sheer versatility and adaptability of Water. Prior to casting this spell, you must select one Ring in which you will be temporarily weakened, and one in which you will be temporarily strengthened. Upon the successful conclusion of this spell, you may transfer a number of unused daily spell slots from the weakened Ring to the strengthened Ring. This spell lasts exactly one day, and then the effects are lost.
STRIKE OF THE FLOWING WATERS    4    WATER    10'    One target individual (may be the caster)    1 round    Water flows over and through obstacles, and so too can those infused with its energy. The target of this spell may ignore bonuses to his opponents’ Armor TN conferred by worn armor, spell effects of Mastery Level 3 and below, and other non- Technique mechanical effects. Against non-human creatures who do not wear armor, this allows the target to treat their Armor TN as 5 lower. This spell does not negate the Reduction awarded by armor, nor does it ignore the increase to Armor TN conferred as a result of an individual adopting the Defense or Full Defense Stances.
SYMBOL OF THE WATER    4    WATER    Touch    Special    Permanent    Priests of the kami are capable of inscribing powerful wards that invoke the power of the elements against all who attempt to pass them. A symbol of water can be inscribed on a solid object, most often a door, window, gate, or any other passageway. Anyone attempting to pass through this passageway or otherwise pass through the area is affected by the protective ward, and must succeed at a Contested Roll using their Fire against the caster’s Water. Those who fail are affected by a crippling terror, and must immediately roll against a Fear 7 effect. You may only have one Symbol of Water in existence at any time, and Symbol spells of different elements may never affect the same area. This spell may be dispelled by another casting of Symbol of Water from any shugenja, or by destroying the surface where the Symbol was etched.
EVER-CHANGING WAVES    5    WATER    Personal    Self    1 hour    Ultimate command over Water can allow flesh to flow like liquid. This spell allows you to physically alter your mortal body, changing your shape to match that of another natural creature (see the Book of the Void for a list of the more common natural creatures found in Rokugan). While in this form, you keep your Mental Traits. For Physical Traits, you keep whichever is higher, yours or those of the animal into which you have transformed. Other natural abilities are gained as well, including natural weapons or sensory abilities. Some traditionalist shugenja sects look down upon this spell as unclean.
THE FINAL BOND    5    WATER    Special    One target object or individual    Instantaneous    The greatest bonds can never be broken. This spell allows you to detect the location of one object or individual well known to you, regardless of their location. The object must be one you have spent a tremendous amount of time around, or have handled frequently in the past. If the target of the spell is an individual, it must be someone well known to you, such as a member of your immediate family or a close friend. You instantly know their approximate location anywhere in the Empire. This is not an exact location, but suffi cient to tremendously narrow any search (for example, “the city of Ryoko Owari Toshi,” or “the northern reaches of the Shinomen Mori”). If the target is outside the Empire of Rokugan, the spell automatically fails.
HANDS OF THE TIDES    5    WATER    100' radius centered on the caster    Targets up to caster's Water Ring    Instantaneous    The exchange of energy via Water is a simple matter that can ultimately lead to the exchange of fl esh as well. Within the area of effect of this spell, you may choose a number of willing targets up to your Water Ring. You may switch the positions among those targets as you see fi t, exchanging one for another. At the end of the spell, there must be a person in every position that was occupied when the spell began, but who is located where can vary depending upon the number of people affected.
POWER OF THE OCEAN    5    WATER    Touch    One target individual    A number of days equal to your School Rank    Perhaps the greatest gift Water can bestow requires a powerful shugenja to impart it to others. This spell is a complex ritual that requires an hour to cast, and can only be cast upon a willing target. For the duration of the spell, the target requires no food, drink, or sleep. A number of times during the duration equal to your School Rank, the target may replenish his Void Points as a Simple Action; this is the equivalent of recovering Void Points via a full night of rest. The target also recovers a number of Wounds per hour equal to twice your Water Ring. If the target of this spell is a shugenja, he regains all expended spell slots at sunrise, regardless of whether he has had any rest. After the spell expires, the target lapses into a state of complete exhaustion. This lasts for exactly half the duration of the spell effect. During this time, the target cannot take any significant physical action, and can only move about sluggishly. Travel is completely impossible.
SUITENGU'S EMBRACE    5    WATER    25'    One target individual    Instantaneous    The Fortune of the Sea is wrathful, and requires little prompting by his loyal adherents to smite another. By invoking the Water kami, you can fill a target’s lungs with seawater, crippling and potentially killing them. If the spell is cast successfully, the target can take no actions other than to attempt to resist the spell. For all intents and purposes, the target is reduced to the Down Wound Level in terms of his ability to take actions. Each round he must make a Stamina Roll (TN 15) to resist. If the target makes three total successes, he spends one additional round vomiting up seawater, and then is fully recovered. However, if the target suffers two consecutive failures, he has fallen unconscious and will die within 1 minute unless some form of magical or medical intervention is made. Although means of combating drowning are not well known in Rokugan, it is possible to save an individual incapacitated by this spell by making a successful Medicine / Intelligence roll at TN 50.
PEACE OF KAMI    6    WATER    Touch    One target individual    Instantaneous    The ultimate benevolence of the Water Dragon is without measure. The target is instantly cured of all diseases, his system purged of any and all poisons, and all Wounds are completely healed.
RISE, WATER    6    WATER    30'    One summoned spirit    Concentration    The sea itself will take form to defend you. The ultimate actualization of the Summon spell, this spell summons a massive kami of pure water to serve you. It takes the form of a vaguely humanoid shape, roughly ten feet in height, with an outline that constantly shifts and changes due to its fluid construction. The kami may move up to 15’ x your Water per round, and saturates the ground in a 20’ radius around it, ensuring that all terrain in that area is at least Moderate Terrain (unless it was already Diffi cult). The manifest kami is treated as if it has all Physical Traits equal to your Water Ring, and attacks with a Jiujutsu Skill Rank equal to half your Water Rank. Damage from these attacks has a DR equal to your Water Ring. For purposes of taking damage, the spirit is considered to have Wounds as though it were a human with Earth equal to your Water Ring, but suffers no Wound penalties. It is Invulnerable (see the creature rules in the Book of Void for details of this ability). If it is successfully reduced to zero Wounds, it is dispelled.
WATER'S SWEET CLARITY    6    WATER    Personal    Target body of water    3 rounds    The greatest form of augury is one that speaks directly and allows others to witness it. By focusing your energy on a still body of water, you can invoke powerful visions of the future based upon your questions. You may ask one question, and the waters will reveal the answer. The answer takes the form of three separate images, which may be connected in any number of ways, including events occurring over time, or perhaps three facets of a single event. Unlike other forms of augury, others may witness these visions as well.
BOUNDLESS SIGHT    1    VOID    50 miles    Self    4 rounds    The most essential lesson of the ishiken is that all is linked through the Void, and through the Void all can be perceived. By focusing your energy, you can look through the veil and see another location as if you were standing there. This location must be familiar to you, and you must have been there at least once before. For the duration of the spell, you can see and hear all that transpires in the other location, but you may not be detected and you may not interact with things or individuals there in any way. During this spell, your body is in a trance-like state that leaves you highly vulnerable to attack (your Armor TN is reduced to 5).
DRAWING THE VOID    1    VOID    Personal    Self    Instantaneous    The ability to reach into the Void itself and gain strength from it is a vital lesson in the training of all ishiken. Upon completion of this spell, you gain a number of additional Void Points equal to your School Rank plus one. If these Void Points take you above the number you may normally possess, then you lose one of the extra Void Points every Round that you do not spend one.
FLOW THROUGH THE VOID    1    VOID    Touch    Up to one cubic foot of pure elemental    Permanent    In the Void, all things are equal, all one and none. By tapping into this connection, you may transform a small amount of pure elemental matter – water, fi re, air, or earth in the form of dirt or soil – into any one other element.
SEE THROUGH LIES    1    VOID    25'    Target individual    Instantaneous    The patterns that comprise all things in the Void exist in individuals as well, and with training, ishiken can recognize them. You learn the highest point Advantage or highest point Disadvantage (your choice) possessed by the target of this spell.
SENSE VOID    1    VOID    Personal    25' radius around the caster    Concentration    Life is evident in the Void like the stars in the night sky. This spell causes you to enter a trance during which you become aware of the existence and location of all living creatures within the radius of the spell. Although you are aware of their location, you cannot see them or any details. You would know if there were three humans waiting outside the castle wall, for instance, but you would not recognize them other than to know that they were present. This also gives you information regarding non-sentient, natural living creatures. Spirits and Shadowlands creatures are recognizable as a gap in your awareness, although this spell cannot recognize Tainted humans as anything other than humans.
TOUCH THE EMPTINESS    1    VOID    30'    One target individual    Instantaneous    The sensation of experiencing the Void fi rsthand can be extremely disturbing for those unaccustomed to it. The target of this spell suffers 1k1 damage and is Dazed.
THE VOID'S CARESS    1    VOID    Touch    One target individual    1 minute    Although beginning students of ishiken-do cannot affect the pattern of the Void, they can make very short-term alterations to it. You may negate any one Mental or Spiritual Disadvantage the target of this spell possesses, up to a maximum of 5 points in value. The Shadowlands Taint may not be removed via this spell, although the mental disorders that can be caused by it can be temporarily alleviated.
WITNESS THE UNTOLD    1    VOID    15'    One target individual    3 rounds    It is possible to gain fl eeting glimpses of things that have not yet happened by peering through the Void. If you are delaying your action, you may interrupt the target of this spell after he has declared his action but before he has taken his action when his Turn comes up. This may be done during each Round for the duration of the spell. (Normally someone delaying their Action cannot interrupt the Action of another participant.)
ALTERING THE COURSE    2    VOID    Personal    Self    1 minute    Ishiken have a much greater capacity to draw upon the Void than others, and may do it consciously rather than unconsciously. You may spend multiple Void Points on any roll made within the duration of this spell. It still must be a roll on which the expenditure of Void Points is allowable (no damage rolls may be augmented via this spell, for example).
DRINK OF YOUR ESSENCE    2    VOID    30'    One target individual    Instantaneous    As an ishiken grows more powerful, he can gain more information from examining an individual’s pattern within the Void. You learn a great deal of information about the target of this spell, including his individual Rings (but not Traits), his current Wound penalties, and a one word summation of his present mood (“hostile,” “sorrowful,” “confused,” etc.).
THE EMPTY VOICE    2    VOID    Personal    Self    5 minutes    Drawing on the essence of everything allows an ishiken to invoke the kami with far greater ease than normal. For the duration of this spell, you may cast spells of other elements without speaking your prayers aloud. This applies only to spells of equal or lower Mastery Level (any spell of Mastery Level 1 or 2).
FALSE WHISPERS    2    VOID    30'    One target individual    1 minute    Mingling the Void of two beings, even for just a moment, can lead to one of the two being manipulated if he is not prepared for it. The target of this spell will repeat the next sentence you say, verbatim, without any foreknowledge of what he is doing. They speak the words in their own normal voice, regardless of how you speak it. This effect will not allow others to cast spells, even if you have them recite a portion of a spell. This spell only allows the effect once, the first time you speak a single sentence during the duration of the spell.
REACH THROUGH THE VOID    2    VOID    50'    Target object, up to five pounds in weight    Instantaneous    All things, both living and unliving, exist within the Void, and can be touched through it. You can manipulate items through the Void, moving them without touching them. These items are small, usually only up to only five pounds, although a powerful shugenja can Raise enough to move somewhat heavier items.
SEVERED FROM THE STEAM    2    VOID    25'    One target individual    5 rounds    Talented ishiken can rob others of their ability to tap into the Void, if only temporarily. If this spell is successful, the target must succeed at a Contested Void Roll against you before they are able to spend any Void Points. This roll does not count as an action for the target, and they must succeed at only one Contested Roll per turn, even if they are spending multiple Void Points per turn as a result of a Technique or other ability.
ECHOES IN THE VOID    3    VOID    25'    One target individual    Concentration    Thoughts are as whispers in the Void, if one knows how to listen. As long as this spell is in effect and you maintain concentration on one target within the area of effect, you can hear what that person is thinking. How this manifests may vary depending upon the individual. Stalwart warriors may have short, curt statements summarizing their thoughts, while artisans may think in terms of poetry.
KHARMIC INTENT    3    VOID    20'    One target individual    10 minutes    Links forged of the Void allow the passage of enormous energy, the substance of the universe itself, between those who share it. You may target any one willing individual with this spell. All remaining Void Points either of you possess are placed in a single pool, which either of you may draw upon as normal. Essentially, this spell allows two individuals to share Void Points back and forth as they see fi t. This also allows ishiken to share the additional Void Points they gain from other Void spells. At the end of the spell’s Duration, all remaining Void Points are divided between the participants, up to their normal maximum number.
MOMENT OF CLARITY    3    VOID    Personal    Self    2 rounds    The entirety of human achievement is refl ected in the Void. You may select any one Skill. You gain temporary ranks in this Skill equal to your Void Ring. If you already posses ranks in this Skill, the new level of Skill replaces your old one; the two are not cumulative.
READ THE ESSENCE    3    VOID    Personal    One target object    Instantaneous    Even objects have resonance, and retain some memory of those who hold them, and events that take place involving them. By meditating upon an object, you can gain a vision of the individual who held it last, or of a major event that might have involved it in some manner. Using this spell on a calligraphy brush, for example, might show the last person who used it to write a letter. Using it on a weapon might instead show the last death it was used to infl ict. The GM has ultimate authority over what vision the spell imparts. Extremely important objects, such as ancestral weapons or standards, may have powerful visions that grip the caster for longer periods of time, rather than imparting simple instantaneous visions.
VOID RELEASE    3    VOID    25'    One target individual    Instantaneous    Most are ignorant of the Void coursing within them, and do not realize that it can be stolen away. You must make a Contested Void Roll against the target of this spell. If successful, the target loses one Void Point, and you gain one Void Point. An additional point is exchanged for every increment of 5 by which you exceed the target’s roll. These temporary Void Points may take you above the maximum number of Void Points you may have, but they expire within one hour if not used. This spell cannot be used on a creature who does not have Void Points, or which has some other mechanical effect that substitutes for Void (such as Naga Akasha or Ratling Name).
BALANCE OF ELEMENTS    4    VOID    Touch    One target individual (may be the caster)    5 rounds / 5 minutes    Flaws in the great pattern of the Void can be overcome, no matter how severe. You may negate all Disadvantages of the target for the duration of the spell. Negative effects inflicted from spells (such as TN penalties, Armor TN reduction, or Trait/Ring reduction) are negated as well, as long as the Mastery Level of the spell causing the penalty is 3 or less. If used during the taxing environment of combat, the duration of this spell is extremely limited (5 rounds). In non-combat situations, however, the effects of the spell can last significantly longer (5 minutes). This temporary replenishing of the target’s pattern also heals 3k3 Wounds.
DRAW CLOSED THE VEIL    4    VOID    50'    One target individual    Instantaneous    The emptiness that is the Void is part and parcel of what separates the various spirit realms from one another, and it is possible to strengthen it in certain areas. You may target any one spirit not native to the mortal realm of Ningen-do. That spirit is banished to its home realm for a minimum amount of time equal to your Void Ring in months. Spirits that possess a physical body in the mortal realm, such as oni or certain shapeshifter spirits, require a Contested Willpower Roll for this spell to affect them. Spirits that are significantly more powerful than you are (GM’s discretion) may prove immune to the effects of this spell.
FILL THE EMPTINESS    4    VOID    Touch    One target individual    Instantaneous    Strengthening an individual’s connection to the Void can replenish their reserves of inner energy. The target of this spell regains all lost Void Points, up to their normal maximum number.
VOID STRIKE    4    VOID    50'    One target individual    Instantaneous    The mortal shell can endure only so much direct contact with the Void; too much, and the fl esh can be destroyed by the exposure. This spell infl icts damage with a DR equal to your Void Ring.
DIVIDE THE SOUL    5    VOID    Personal    Self    1 minute    The true mysteries of the Void are beyond the comprehension of non-ishiken. Using this spell, you may divide your soul across the Void, and exist in two places in the mortal realm simultaneously. The second “you” appears anywhere you might wish within your sight when you cast the spell. You have full knowledge of all that happens in both locations, and may take any normal actions in either place (both manifestations may take actions simultaneously as if they were two separate individuals). Only one manifestation may make a Spell Casting Roll per round. Any Wounds suffered by either manifestation are combined when the spell ends, and if either of your selves dies, both die.
REFORGE    5    VOID    Touch    One object    Permanent    All is one and one is all. You may take any single object and transform it into any other object of comparable size. This will only work on an object that is uniform in its construction, rather than assembled from multiple pieces. This spell will not affect living material. Although the effect of this spell is permanent, it can be reversed by a second casting on the same object, even by a different ishiken.
UNBOUND ESSENCE    5    VOID    25'    One target individual    1 hour    Tampering with the pattern of another being’s Void can result in catastrophic changes to their abilities. The target’s Rings are reordered at random, along with their Traits. For instance, a target might exchange his Air Ring for his Fire Ring, and his Water Ring for his Earth Ring for the duration of this spell. Mental and Physical Traits exchange their values if those values are greater than the Ring. In the above example, if your target has Air 3 and Refl exes 4, he would instead have Fire 3 and Agility 4, with his values for those Traits reassigned to his Air and Reflexes.RING OF THE VOID    6    VOID    Personal    Self    Concentration    Rare and extraordinarily powerful, even by shugenja standards, this prayer calls on the unique favor of the dragon whose domain the ishiken tread: the Void Dragon. Unlike most spells, this is not something that is taught by others, but rather is simply learned through insight by those capable of casting it (and as such it has no scroll associated with it). This spell, more of a meditation ritual, actually allows you to commune with the Void Dragon itself, a feat few mortals have ever managed to perform successfully. During your brief moments of contact with this divine entity, you may ask it questions as you see fit. The Void Dragon knows all that can be known, although it is under no particular compulsion to answer you directly, or even at all. Respect must be maintained at all times, for those who have attempted this feat in the past and failed to pay homage to their patron have ceased to exist altogether.
RISE FROM THE ASHES    6    VOID    Touch    One target individual    Instantaneous    Everything that exists has a pattern in the Void, a thread woven in the tapestry that is existence. By recalling the memory of that pattern, you can reverse recent effects that have happened to a living creature. When you cast this spell on an individual, you are essentially restoring their existence within the Void in accordance with their previous self. Upon completion of the spell, the person is immediately restored to the state they were in eight hours prior to when the spell was begun. Any injuries suffered during this time, the effects of diseases or poisons, even the acquisition of supernatural conditions such as the Shadowlands Taint or corruption by the Lying Darkness, can be undone in this manner. Upon the completion of this spell, you lose all Void Points, and you may not regain Void Points for a period of three days, after which they will begin to recover at one Void Point per day until you have your maximum normal amount again. This spell cannot be used to restore someone who has died.
UNMAKE THE WORLD    6    VOID    Personal    50'    One target creatures, individual or object    Instantaneous    The most powerful and terrifying ability of those who command the Void is the ability to destroy the bonds that exist between the fi ve elements. By eradicating the bonds between existing elements, you can effectively cause one object or creature to cease to exist. When you cast this spell on a living creature, you must succeed at a Contested Roll using your Void against the target’s Earth. If you are successful, they are instantly killed, and their remains disappear into the Void. Success is automatic against a non-magical object, but attempting to destroy an awakened object, such as a nemuranai, may have dire ramifi cations at the GM’s discretion (the kami contained within an awakened object frequently respond very poorly to this manner of attack, for instance).
