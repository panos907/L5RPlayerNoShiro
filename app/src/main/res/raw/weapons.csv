DAI-KYU    4/500    Kyujutsu    Large    None    Special Rules: Increase the TN of all attack rolls by+10 if used on foot.Designed to be fi red from horseback, the dai-kyu is composed of multiple pieces of wood, horn, or sinew bound together with glue. These are easily the most powerful of the standard bows used by armed forces in Rokugan, and are considered nearly as valuable by an archer as his katana.(Minimum Strength 3 required to wield)
HAN-KYU    1/100    Kyujutsu    Small    None    Special Rules: Increase the TN of all attack rolls by +10 if used from horseback.Smaller than the yumi and generally easier to use and carry, the han-kyu is a popular bow for use by traveling magistrates or scouts who depend upon speed and stealth. A han-kyu is typically crafted from a single piece of wood or horn.
YUMI    3/250    Kyujutsu    Large    None    This is the basic bow carried by infantry archers, and by samurai who travel independently of armies or other large groups. It is a powerful bow, although not quite as powerful as the dai-kyu, but its curvature makes it inconvenient to use on horseback.
DAI TSUCHI    5k2    Heavy weapons    Large    None    A massive two-handed war hammer popular in the Crab Clan, the dai tsuchi is one of the more effective tools the samurai of Rokugan have against the large, well-armored creatures of the Shadowlands that occasionally threaten the Empire. In trained hands, the dai tsuchi focuses its force in a very small area and can shatter armor or the thick hide of demons without great diffi culty.
MASAKARI    2k3    Heavy weapons    Medium    None    The masakari is actually a one-handed ax, a variant of the axes used by woodsmen and lumber harvesters throughout the Empire. It is signifi cantly smaller than the other heavy weapons, but is wielded in much the same manner, hence its inclusion in this category.
ONO    0k4    Heavy weapons    Large    None    The ono is a large two-handed ax that can easily be used to fell trees or to sever limbs. The sheer force that can be channeled by an overhand strike into the thin edge of an axe blade results in perhaps the most devastating personal weapon that a trained warrior can wield.
TETSUBO    3k3    Heavy weapons    Large    None    The tetsubo has been the signature weapon of many great Crab Clan heroes, particularly during the Clan War, and as such has become quite a symbol for many young aspiring Hida warriors. A tetsubo is essentially a metal club with steel (or in rare cases jade) studs embedded along its length. This simple design is unparalleled for shattering armor and other hardened targets.
TANTO    1k1    Knives    Small    None    The tanto is a very simple, basic knife. Many samurai carry a tanto for grooming purposes.
JITTE & SAI    1k1    Knives    Small    None    The jitte and sai are weapons that were adapted from farming implements during the early days of the Empire, and which have slowly gained acceptance with the samurai caste since that time. The jitte in particular is an accepted symbol of a magisterial position. Both are steel cylinders roughly a foot long that possess a short handle and a blunt tip. Both possess metal prongs that originate from the divide between the handle and the blade; the jitte has one prong while the sai has two symmetrical prongs. The jitte and sai have gradually gained acceptance among samurai primarily because they are ideal weapons to use for disarming someone without infl icting any signifi cant damage.
KAMA    0k2    Knives    Small    Peasant    The kama was improvised from a sickle of sorts, and the vast majority of kama in the Empire are still being used in the fi elds by farmers to harvest crops. However, the kama has also become the signature weapon of a great many Mantis samurai, particularly among the Yoritomo family, so it is generally regarded as a weapon even if it is perfectly acceptable for peasants to possess them.
BLOWGUN    0k0    Ninjutsu    Medium    None    Special Rules: Triple an opponent’s Armor TN bonus from armor. The damage increase from the Ninjutsu Skill increases the blowgun’s damage to 1k1 at Rank 3 and 2k1 at Rank 7. Reloading a blowgun is a Free Action.      The blowgun is a popular weapon among ninja because it is inexpensive, simple to use, and can be used outside of combat as a breathing implement while submerged (which comes up more often than one might imagine for ninja). Small darts are placed within the tube and then propelled at the target by blowing through it forcefully. Although the darts infl ict virtually no damage, they are usually poisoned, which is the real benefi t to using this weapon in the fi rst place. Blowguns have an effective range of fi fty feet.
SHURIKEN    1k1    Ninjutsu    Small    None    Special Rules: Shuriken may be thrown up to twenty five feet.   The shuriken is perhaps the defi nitive tool for ninja, and one that immediately identifi es them as a member of their profession. A shuriken is a small metal disk with sharpened edges or fl at spikes that protrude out from the center. They are cheaply made, easily concealed or disguised, disposable, and simple to produce in large numbers. Shuriken can be and often are coated with poison. Because of their size, shuriken do not add the wielder’s Strength to their DR when used as ranged weapons, and their damage dice do not explode.
TSUBUTE    1k1    Ninjutsu    Small    None    Special Rules: Shuriken may be thrown up to thirty feet.   The opposite of shuriken in many ways, tsubute are small, blunt, disc-shaped stones that have been ground down deliberately to be used as thrown weapons. Ninja skilled in the use of the tsubute can easily improvise a substitute if the weapon is not available; any round stone will suffi ce. Tsubute have very little value as offensive weapons and are used more as a tool for distraction and harassment. Because of their small size, tsubute do not add the wielder’s Strength to their DR when used as ranged weapons, and their damage dice do not explode.
BISENTO    3k3    Polearms    Large    None    A bisento is a wooden shaft with a heavy sword blade at the end. The blade is heavier than that of a katana or nagamaki, and the bisento can be a dangerously top-heavy weapon in the hands of someone not trained in its use. It is a popular weapon among certain sects of sohei, or warrior monks, but beyond that it is not commonly seen.
NAGAMAKI    2k3    Polearms    Large    None    The nagamaki is basically a sword blade (although not as well-made as that of the katana) attached to a short wooden pole. It is designed to be a lighter weapon, wielded in one hand, and combines the virtues of the sword with the leverage of a hafted weapon.
NAGINATA    3k2    Polearms    Large    Samurai    The naginata is the most respected hafted weapon used in Rokugan, and is particularly popular among samurai-ko and the warriors of the Phoenix Clan. The naginata is similar to the bisento in that it is a sword blade attached to the end of a spear shaft. It is lighter than the bisento, and longer than the nagamaki.
SASUMATA    0k2    Polearms    Large    None    Special Rules: The sasumata may be used to initiate and maintain a grapple.   The sasumata is also known as the “man catcher” due to its original purpose, which was to detain without causing any signifi cant damage. The weapon is a four-foot wooden shaft with a barbed crescent blade at the end. This end was used to trap an opponent against the ground or a wall without inflicting damage, assuming the target does not struggle. Magistrates and their deputies use the sasumata to detain drunken or disorderly samurai.
SODEGARAMI    1k1    Polearms    Large    None    Special Rules: The sodegarami may be used to initiate and maintain a grapple.   While the sasumata is meant to capture via pinning, the sodegarami is meant to detain by entangling the garments of a target. The four-foot wooden shaft has a t-shaped metal head covered in hooks and barbs, making it easy to snag an opponent’s clothing and secure it.
KYOKETSU-SHOGI    0k1    Chain weapons    Large    None    Special Rules: Double an opponent’s bonus to Armor TN from armor.
KUSARIGAMA    0k2    Chain weapons    Large    None    Special Rules: When attacking with weighted end it has DR 0k1.The most common chain weapon, the kusarigama is particularly popular with samurai of the Mantis Clan. It is essentially a kama (see Knives) attached at the base of the handle to a length of chain roughly fi ve to six feet long. The other end of the chain is attached to a weight, typically a metal cylinder or sphere.
MANRIKIKUSARI    1k1    Chain weapons    Large    None    This inexpensive weapon is a length of chain with weights on both ends. Traditionally these have been small to medium sized cylindrical weights, although in the Crab lands it has recently become more popular to use large spherical weights instead.
KUMADE    1k1    Spears    Large    Peasant    Even the Mantis Clan has not truly embraced the use of the kumade as a weapon. It is essentially a rake, consisting of a wooden handle with a sharpened metal tip at one end and a series of metal hooks at the other. The hooked end is used to pull stumps or weeds from the ground, while the spear-like end is used to prod or puncture objects in the way and then move them aside to be collected later. The generally flimsy construction of the kumade is the principal reason it has not been adopted for use as a weapon by the Yoritomo family.
MAI CHONG    0k3    Spears    Large    None    Special Rules: The mai chong can be thrown accurately up to 25’.The mai chong is a curious and unique weapon, developed and used almost exclusively by the samurai of the Boar Clan deep in the Twilight Mountains. A handful of travelers who have visited the Boar lands took to the weapon, and passed the teachings regarding its use on to their children or students. While it is not unheard of to fi nd a samurai wielding the mai chong outside the Boar province, it is extremely rare. The mai chong is an eight foot wooden shaft with a foot long metal tip. The tip has three points, one forward-facing and two at right angles to the fi rst. There are two metal spikes facing outward from the forward point as well, allowing both slashing attacks as well as thrusting.
LANCE    3k4    Spears    Large    None    Special Rules: The listed DR only applies if the lance is used from horseback and used to make an attack directly following a Move Action. Under any other circumstances, it possesses DR 1k2. Using the lance in melee combat without a Move Action increases the TN of all attack rolls by +5 on horseback and +10 on foot. A lance shatters if it infl icts more than 30 Wounds in one attack.The lance is a weapon adapted from gaijin cultures, and is virtually never seen outside the ranks of Unicorn or Ox samurai. The lance is used only from horseback, where it is braced under the rider’s shoulder with the tip pointing outward. The horse is then spurred to a gallop and the sharpened tip of the long, wooden shaft is levied against a target. The effects can be devastating, although most lances shatter upon impact. The lance is very poorly designed for anything other than a charging attack, and is virtually useless under any other combat circumstances.
NAGE-YARI    1k2    Spears    Medium    None    Special Rules: The nage-yari may be thrown accurately up to 50’.The nage-yari is essentially a javelin, a shorter but slightly heavier version of the yari. It is roughly 3 to 4 feet in length with a metal tip, and can be used effectively in melee combat or thrown short distances.
YARI    2k2    Spears    Large    None    Special Rules: The yari can be thrown a maximum range of 30’, and has DR 1k2 when thrown.The yari is a basic spear, six to eight feet in length. It is used two handed when wielded on foot, and one handed when on horseback. Yari are typically given to ashigaru legions and anti-cavalry forces. Like the nage-yari, it can be thrown short distances with limited accuracy.
BO    1k2    Staves    Large    None    The simplest and most common weapon in the Empire, the bo is a simple wooden staff 5 to 6 feet in length. It is used as a walking staff by travelers and monks, and doubles as a weapon for those bold enough to use it. Like most staves, the bo has almost no power to defeat armor.
JO    0k2    Staves    Medium    None    The jo is essentially half of a bo, and is a short staff roughly 3 feet in length. They are often used in pairs to deliver a rapid series of concussive strikes.
MACHI-KANSHISHA    0k2    Staves    Medium    None    This extremely unconventional weapon is, more or less, a metal smoking pipe. It is an effective weapon because of its size and shape, which is a hollow metal tube roughly three feet in length. In addition to its use as a smoking implement, it can also be used to stun an opponent via a sharp blow to the head. The machi-kanshisha pipe is seen almost exclusively in the hands of the Kaeru family that governs the City of the Rich Frog
NUNCHAKU    1k2    Staves    Small    Peasant    An adapted threshing tool, the nunchaku is simple to build and surprisingly effective. It consists of two foot-long wooden handles connected by a foot-long length of chain. Nunchaku are a very poor weapon unless the wielder is skilled in their use, in which case their use is beautiful to watch and delivers a relentless fl urry of bludgeoning strikes.
SANG KAUW    1k2    Staves    Medium    None    Special Rules: The listed DR is for the crescent blade. When using the shield sang kauw it has a DR of 2k1.Crescent Blade & Shield: The sang kauw is a peculiar weapon only seen in the hands of those who choose to study exotic fighting styles. It is a three to four foot wooden shaft with a metal spike on each end. The crescent blade sang kauw has a crescent-shaped blade in the center that can be used to fend off attackers, while the shield sang kauw has a metal shield for increased protection.
TONFA    0k3    Staves    Medium    Peasant    The tonfa has its origin as the handle of a millstone. It consists of a wooden shaft roughly the length of a man’s forearm, with a handle on the side that allows it to be held along the forearm. Held in this manner it is an effective defensive tool, but can also be spun as an offensive weapon
KATANA    3k2    Kenjutsu    Medium    Samurai     Special Rules: A character may spend one Void Point to increase a damage roll made using a katana by 1k1 (Void Points cannot normally be spent to enhance damage rolls). Only one Void Point may be spent in this manner, even if the character has an ability that would allow him to spend more than one Void Point per round.The katana is the quintessential weapon of the samurai caste. It represents the soul of the samurai who carries it, and while typically only bushi or those trained in the blade’s use carry them with them at all times, all samurai typically have one that they own, even if it remains in their home. Courtiers and shugenja do not usually carry a katana with them because doing so implies they are trained in its use, which would in turn place an expectation upon them to defend themselves. A katana is typically kept within a family and handed down from generation to generation. The eldest child in a generation receives his grandfather’s blade. However,it is possible for a samurai who serves his lord well to possess multiple katana, including not only his grandfather’s blade, but a blade bestowed for valorous service, another from an appointment to the position of Imperial magistrate, etc
NINJA-TO    2k2    Kenjutsu    Medium    Ninja    Special Rules: The ninja-to is a medium weapon, but is considered a small weapon for the purposes of concealment. If a ninja-to infl icts more than 40 Wounds in a single attack, its blade breaks.As reviled as the katana is revered, the ninja-to is the favored weapon of the ninja. Ninja often put their blades to esoteric uses such as climbing in addition to combat. Unlike other swords, ninja-to are crudely made, unattractive, and easily broken. A ninja who loses his weapon can easily replace it without signifi cant expense.
NO-DACHI    3k3    Kenjutsu    Large    None    The no-dachi is perhaps the largest weapon commonly wielded by samurai. It is similar in most respects to the katana, save that it is 5 to 7 feet in length. It was conceived as primarily an anti-cavalry weapon, at which it excels. Brash or highlytrained bushi also wield it in melee, however, which is diffi cult but highly effective when mastered.
PARANGU    2k2    Kenjutsu    Medium    Peasant    Special Rules: If a parangu inflicts more than 30 Wounds in a single attack, its blade breaks.The parangu is basically a machete, a thin metal blade made of unfolded steel and used in a harsh chopping motion to clear underbrush and other vegetation out of the path for farming or making one’s way through the wilderness. The parangu is popular aboard Mantis ships for cutting ropes or cloth without having to worry about protecting one’s katana. Parangu are typically made of scrap metal and have a high chance of breaking in combat with a true blade.
SCIMITAR    2k3    Kenjutsu    Medium    None    A heavy, curved blade that originated far beyond the boundaries of the Emerald Empire, the scimitar was brought back to Rokugan by the Unicorn Clan after their eight centuries of wandering the world at large. It is rarely made of folded steel, and as such has limited durability compared to the katana, and only sees use among Unicorn samurai, primarily the Moto family.
WAKIZASHI    2k2    Kenjutsu    Medium    Samurai    Special Rules: A wakizashi may be thrown up to 20’ as a ranged weapon.While the katana represents the soul of a samurai, the wakizashi represents his honor. Every member of the samurai caste, even the most pious shugenja or delicate artisan, possesses a wakizashi that signifi es his or her station. Wakizashi are not always carried by such individuals, but they are never far away, and are always taken with them even when traveling. Because of its status as a symbol of the bearer’s honor, it is the wakizashi with which the ritual of seppuku is performed.
WAR FAN    0k1    War fan    Small    None    There are a variety of war fans, also known as tessen, that are popular throughout the Empire. Different styles have varying levels of popularity depending upon the Clan in question, although they are certainly most popular in the Lion and Crane lands. Some are short metal shafts with small circular or shaped metal sheets attached, and bear only a passing resemblance to fans
ARMOR PIERCING    1k1    Arrows    None    None    Special Rules: Ignores the Armor TN bonus provided by armor
HUMMING BULB    0k1    Arrows    None    None    Special Rules: Makes a loud whistling sound
ROPE CUTTER    1k1    Arrows    None    None    Special Rules: 2 Free Raises for Called Shots against inanimate objects; 1/2 bow range
WILLOW LEAF    2k2    Arrows    None    None    None
FLESH CUTTER    2k3    Arrows    None    None    Special Rules: Double the Armor TN bonus provided by armor; 1/2 bow range
