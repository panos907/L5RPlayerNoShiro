Daidoji Bushi    THE FORCE OF HONOR    1    The Iron Warrior serves as the shield of his clan, defending the honor and homes of the Crane. You gain a bonus of your Honor Rank (rounded down) minus 4 to your Wounds at each Wound Rank, to a minimum bonus of one. (Thus at Honor Rank 6.5, you gain a bonus of 2 Wounds to each Wound Rank.) Additionally, you gain a bonus of +1k0 to the total of all attack rolls while in the Attack Stance.    THE SHIELD OF FAITH    2    The Iron Warrior truly believes that his work serves a higher purpose. When you perform the Guard Maneuver, the benefi ts last for an additional Round. Additionally, the Armor TN bonus of the Guard Maneuver is increased by 5. (This bonus applies to both your Armor TN and your target’s Armor TN – thus, you suffer no TN penalty when Guarding, and your target gains a bonus of +15 to his Armor TN instead of +10.)    STRIKE BENEATH THE VEIL    3    The Daidoji is an intractable foe, devastating to face under any circumstances. You may make melee attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action while in the Attack Stance.    VIGILANCE OF MIND    4    The Iron Warrior is always on the lookout for dangers. You may spend a Void Point during the Reactions Stage to target an opponent who has attempted to strike at either you or the target of your Guard Maneuver during the Round. You gain a bonus of +2k1 to the total of all attack and damage rolls against that opponent during the next Round.    TO TREAD ON THE SWORD    5    When the Iron Warrior fi ghts to protect his charge, he will continue on long after others would perish. You may spend two Void Points as a Free Action when someone declares an action against the target of your Guard Maneuver. You become the target of the action instead (if it would be a legal action – GM’s discretion in questionable instances). You also gain one Free Action that you may use immediately for the sole purpose of moving toward the target of your Guard Maneuver. If you cannot reach your target, this Technique has no effect.
Doji Courtier    THE SOUL OF HONOR    1    Apprentice Doji courtiers are taught to rely on their Honor when dealing with others, infusing their every word and gesture with the power of their purity, and to build networks of allies by discerning what others need and fulfilling those needs. So long as you maintain your Honor Rank at 6.0 or better, you gain a Free Raise on all Courtier, Sincerity, and Etiquette rolls. Also, by conversing with another person for a few minutes, you can make a Contested Roll of Courtier (Manipulation) / Awareness against the target’s Etiquette (Courtesy) / Awareness to learn whether they are in need of any favors or assistance (such as needing travel papers to reach another province, for example).    SPEAKING IN SILENCE    2    At this Rank the Doji learns Cadence, the art of communicating through subtle gestures and body language. This gives them a huge advantage in the courts by allowing them to share information while their rivals are none the wiser. You can roll Courtier/Intelligence at TN 15 to communicate simple ideas and instructions (things like “distract them,” “this favors us,” or “intercept that person”) with any other Crane who is trained in the Doji Courtier School or who has at least 5 Ranks in the Courtier skill. More complex ideas can be conveyed with Raises, although there is an upper limit (set by the GM) on how complicated Cadence can become.    THE PERFECT GIFT    3    The Doji build their networks of alliances through selflessness, offering others what they need so that in future the Doji may rely on their assistance. Any time you are in court or in an urban area, you can roll Courtier/Awareness at TN 20 to come up with a suitable gift or a helpful political favor for someone else. By calling Raises on this roll, you can acquire a rarer or more potent gift or favor. If such a gift or favor is accepted, you may immediately take that person as an Ally with 1-point Devotion, without XP cost (subject to the GM’s permission).    VOICE OF HONOR    4    At this Rank the Doji has learned the art of political maneuvering, making his positions and arguments appear synonymous with Honor, forcing anyone who disagrees with him to take a dishonorable position. In any debate or argument, you may make a Contested Roll of Courtier (Manipulation) / Awareness against the target’s Etiquette (Courtesy) / Awareness. If you win the roll, the opponent is forced to concede that his position conflicts with the demands of Honor and Bushido, and if he persists in his position he will commit a breach of etiquette. (It is the GM’s discretion, based on the circumstances, as to whether it is a minor or major breach.)    THE GIFT OF THE LADY    5    The final training of the Doji teaches them the art of influencing the emotions of others, making friends and allies out of almost anyone – even bitter enemies. By conversing with someone for a few minutes, you may make a Contested Roll of  Courtier (Manipulation) / Awareness against the target’s Etiquette (Courtesy) / Willpower. If the target is an Ally, you gain a bonus of +5k0 to the total of this roll. With a success, you shift the target’s emotions in a favorable direction, persuading them to listen to your advice and counsel. The GM is the final arbiter but in general, the target will go along with anything you suggest which does not conflict with his basic loyalties.
Asahina Shugenja    THE SOUL'S GRACE    1    The Asahina have harnessed the power of the kami for art, not war. You may spend a Void Point to reduce the total of all opponents’ damage rolls inflicted within 20’ of you by 0k1 for a  number of rounds equal to your School Rank. (Using this technique again before its duration expires “resets” the duration but does not increase the damage penalty.) You also gain a Free Raise on any spell with the Defense keyword.
Kakita Bushi    THE WAY OF THE CRANE    1    The study of the sword demonstrates the many ways in which the art of Kakita's technique can be applied. You add twice your Iaijutsu Skill Rank to all Initiative rolls. You gain a bonus of +1k1 plus your School Rank to the total of all attack and Focus rolls while assuming the Center Stance. This bonus also applies during the Combat Round following one in which you assumed the Center Stance.    SPEED OF LIGHTNING    2    Enemies who are slow or weak of spirit are doomed to failure. You gain a bonus of +2k0 to the total of all attack rolls against those with lower Initiative than your own.    FIRST AND LAST STRIKE    3    A Kakita Bushi is feared throughout the Empire as a follower of the oldest and most venerated dueling tradition in the Empire. You may Strike fi rst in a duel if you win the Iaijutsu/ Void roll by a difference of 3 or higher. You gain a Free Raise on your Strike for each additional margin of 3 instead of 5.    ONE STRIKE, TWO CUTS    4    With one pure strike, the advanced student of Kakita’s technique cuts his opponent twice. You may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action while using weapons with the Samurai keyword.    STRIKE WITH NO THOUGHT    5    A true student of Kakita requires no thought  before the perfect strike, depending entirely on instinct. You may take one Simple Action per Turn while assuming the Center Stance. You gain the benefi ts of Center Stance while you assume the Stance instead of the following Turn, and you may remain in Center Stance as many consecutive Turns as desired. The Simple Action you take can be a Move Action (bypassing the normal restriction of the Center Stance).
Ide Courtier    THE HEART SPEAKS    1    The Ide are taught to adapt instantly to new customs and social nuances, allowing them to avoid giving offense in even the most dangerous and hostile of courts. Also, since they must often deal with foreigners who might react poorly to lies or manipulation, they are taught to employ honesty and direct speech wherever possible. In any situation in which you might inadvertently give offense, whether through accident or ignorance (such as being unaware of a daimyo’s hostility to a particular subject of conversation), you may roll Etiquette (Courtesy) / Awareness at TN 20 to avoid doing so. You gain a Free Raise when rolling Sincerity (Honesty), but any time you roll Sincerity (Deceit), your TN is increased by +5.    PIERCING THE VEILS    2    After centuries of dealing with unpredictable and sometimes violent folk in the Burning Sands, the Ide have learned an almost preternatural ability to read the emotions of others, recognizing their true feelings and, hopefully, steering away from trouble. You may attempt to read someone else’s true emotions in a social situation by making a Contested Social Roll of your Etiquette / Awareness against the target’s Etiquette / Willpower. With a success, you gain a simple, general idea of their true feelings – which can be very useful when those feelings are not the same as their outward actions. You may Raise for better information, subject to the GM’s adjudication. (For example, two Raises might tell you, “The Doji is actually hoping for your success against the Dragon.”)    THE HEART LISTENS    3    The Ide family’s training emphasizes friendship and good personal relations as the key to successful diplomacy. You may attempt to sway someone’s attitudes toward you in a positive direction. This requires spending at least 10 minutes in conversation, after which you may make a Contested Roll of your Sincerity (Honesty) / Awareness against their Etiquette (Courtesy) / Willpower. With a success, you shift their attitude toward you in a positive direction. (A hostile individual will become more neutral, an undecided individual will become friendly, etc.) If you make at least two successful Raises on this roll, the target will regard you as an Ally for the remainder of this day (subject to GM approval). This technique cannot be used on Sworn Enemies, and the GM is the fi nal arbiter on whether it functions against unusual targets such as nonhuman creatures.    ANSWERING THE HEART    4    At this level of training, the Ide have become true masters of mediation, able to see past all the deceptions and false fronts of diplomacy and discern the true solution to any problem. When using your Rank Two and Rank Three techniques, you may roll additional unkept dice equal to your School Rank.    THE IMMOVABLE HAND OF PEACE    5     The final lesson the Ide school teaches its students is to be such perfect mediators that no honorable person can raise a hand against them in violence. You may spend a Void point to make a Contested Roll of your Sincerity (Honesty) / Awareness against a target individual’s Etiquette (Courtesy) / Awareness. If you win the roll, the target cannot take any hostile action against you (physical, social, or magical) for a number of hours equal to twice your School Rank, as long as you likewise refrain from hostility against that person. This Technique does not work against those with an Honor Rank less than 2.0, or who possess no Honor Rank (animals, oni, etc).
Moto Bushi    THE WAY OF THE UNICORN    1    The Moto combat style is a wild, unfettered fury that intimidates witnesses. You may wield any two-handed meleeWeapon with one hand (except for bows). You gain a bonus of +1k0 to damage rolls while mounted, using a scimitar, or while using a two-handed melee meleeWeapon (these bonuses do not stack). Scimitars have the Samurai keyword for you.    SHINSEI’S SMILE    2    The Moto are famed for slicing their enemies’ throats from ear to ear, a gruesome display they proudly call Shinsei’s Smile. You take advantage of your opponent’s weakened state, gaining a bonus to your attack rolls equal to half of his Wound Rank TN penalties, rounded down. For example, if your opponent is unhurt and in the Healthy Wound Rank, you do not gain a bonus. If your opponent is in the Crippled Wound Rank, you gain a bonus of +10 to the total of attack rolls.    DESERT WIND STRIKE    3    Power and precision are equally valuable to the Moto. You may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action when using a melee meleeWeapon.    HE CHARGE OF MADNESS    4    The Moto fighting style is utterly relentless, allowing him to move from one foe to another without ceasing. Once per skirmish, if you successfully bring a target down to the Out Wound Level, you may immediately make an additional attack as a Free Action. This attack may not target the same target as the attack that activated this Technique. You may not make Raises on this attack.    MOTO CANNOT YIELD    5     A Moto never surrenders. While mounted or while assuming the Full Attack Stance you keep an additional number of damage dice equal to half your Strength, rounded down. You only gain this bonus while wielding a two-handed meleeWeapon or a meleeWeapon with the Samurai keyword.
Utaku Battle Maiden    RIDING IN HARMONY    1    The Utaku Battle Maidens value honor above all. You gain a bonus equal to your Honor Rank to one attack roll per Round. While mounted, you may instead choose to apply this bonus to one damage roll if you choose. You gain a bonus equal to your Honor Rank to the total of all Horsemanship rolls.    THE VOID OF WAR    2    An Utaku can sacrifice defense for speed if the flow of the battle calls for it. During Stage 1 of any Combat Round, you may add 5 to either your Initiative Score or your Armor TN. This bonus lasts until you use this Technique again or the skirmish ends.    SENSING THE BREEZE    3    The natural feel of the saddle lends an Utaku unnatural freedom of movement. While mounted, you may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action.    WIND NEVER STOPS    4    Like the wind across the battlefield, the charge of an Utaku is unstoppable. While mounted, you may overrun the enemy by spending a Void Point. You may take a Simple Action to charge the enemy and attack him at the end of your movement. (Both the movement and attack take the same Simple Action. If you are mounted, this Action uses the movement rate of your steed.) If this attack succeeds, you gain a bonus of +2k1 to the total of all damage rolls this Turn.    OTAKU’S BLESSING    5    The Utaku carry the honor of their founder as their shield. At the beginning of your Turn, you may spend a Void Point as a Free Action to activate this Technique. You add your Honor Rank to all damage rolls and Bugei Skill Rolls this Turn. This bonus stacks with those from Riding in Harmony.
Iuchi Shugenja    SPIRIT OF THE WIND    1    The Iuchi harness the power of the elements to grant the waves’ speed to others. As a Complex Action, you may sacrifi ce one spell slot of any element to grant one target individual an additional Simple Move Action. This Simple Action is in addition to the target’s normal Actions per Round. The additional Action must be used on the target’s next Turn or it is lost. You also gain a Free Raise on any spell with the Travel keyword.
Yoritomo Bushi    THE WAY OF THE MANTIS    1    Mantis bushi learn to fight on the pitching decks of ships and to use anything within reach as a meleeWeapon. You suffer no penalties to movement or attacks for rough or uneven terrain. You do not lose Glory or Honor when using improvised weapons, or weapons with the Peasant keyword, in combat. You suffer no penalties for fighting with a Small or Medium meleeWeapon in your off-hand if that meleeWeapon has the Peasant keyword. Finally, you gain a bonus of +1k0 to all attack rolls.    VOICE OF THE STORM    2    Your wild, unfettered attacks disorient your opponent and opens holes in his defenses. Every time you hit an opponent in melee, his Armor TN is reduced by 5. This penalty only applies to your attacks, and lasts for 2 Rounds. This Technique is cumulative (a number of times equal to your School Rank), and the duration rese ts with each application.    STRIKE OF THE MANTIS    3    A Yoritomo strikes as swiftly as the storm. You may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action while using weapons with the Samurai or Peasant keyword.    THE ROLLING WAVE    4    The Yoritomo Bushi reacts with the fl ow of combat, deftly dodging blows while reaching his target. If you move at least 5 feet, you gain a bonus of +10 to your Armor TN until your next Turn. You may sacrifice this bonus during your Turn before you roll for any attack to gain two Free Raises that may only be used to perform the Knockdown Maneuver.    HAND OF OSANO-WO    5    The Yoritomo Bushi strikes with brutal force, digging his weapons deep into his target. You may choose to activate this Technique by spending a Void Point as a Free Action. You keep an additional number of damage dice equal to your Strength. If these attacks hit a Prone target, you gain a bonus of +0k2 to the total of your damage rolls against that target.
Tsuruchi Archer    ALWAYS BE READY    1    The Tsuruchi Archer must be prepared to fight against his foes with little warning. You gain a bonus of +1k0 to the total of all attack rolls while using a bow. Additionally, you gain a bonus of +3 to your Initiative Score.    THE ARROW KNOWS THE WAY    2    A Tsuruchi must not aim, but simply allows the arrow to follow its own path. You gain one Free Raise that can only be used to make the Called Shot Maneuver. Additionally, you gain a bonus of +2k0 to the total of all damage rolls while using a bow.    THE WASP’S STING    3    Tsuruchi’s technique teaches its students uncanny speed. You may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action when using a bow.    FLIGHT OF NO-MIND    4    The true archer does not concern himself with the arrow, but exists only to loose it. Once per skirmish, you may spend a Void Point as a Complex Action to shoot an arrow that knows exactly where it must go. This attack ignores all effects of armor, as well as any penalties from Wound Ranks or visibility. You may make Raises but you cannot perform the Extra Attack Maneuver for this attack. You may not shoot a target that is further than your bow’s normal range with this Technique.    TSURUCHI’S EYE    5    The final lesson of Tsuruchi is that there is nothing that cannot be felled by a single arrow. You may make a ranged attack as a Complex Action to gain a bonus of +4k1 to the total of both the attack and damage rolls. You may not use this Technique in conjunction with Flight of No-Mind.
Yoritomo Courtier    DUTY BEFORE HONOR    1    Like the Yasuki, the Mantis courtiers are merchants as well as diplomats, and they cultivate a personal style built around intimidation rather than friendship. Furthermore, they spend much of their lives outside of the courts dealing with some of the more unsavory characters in Rokugan. You do not lose Glory or Honor for using the Commerce skill in public, and you do not lose Honor for using the Intimidation (Control) skill. Any time you are making Social Skill Rolls against ronin, bandits, gang members, mercenaries, pirates, and other lawless types, you gain a number of Free Raises equal to your School Rank.    STORM HEART    2    When the time comes to act in the courts, the Yoritomo eschew the eloquent words of the Doji or the subtle gibes of the Scorpion in favor of straightforward bullying, browbeating friend and foe alike into accepting their position. When you use the Intimidation (Control) Skill, your Willpower is considered to be one Rank higher. When you use the Intimidation (Control) skill against a samurai with lower Status Rank than you, your Willpower is considered two Ranks higher instead.    COMMAND THE WINDS    3    The Mantis are taught to put the force of their boorish and aggressive behavior behind their words in court, making it difficult to tell whether they are lying or telling the truth. A number of times per session equal to your School Rank, if you have failed a Sincerity Social Skill Roll, you may re-roll it as an Intimidation (Control) Social Skill Roll instead. You must take the result of the Intimidation roll.    WILL OF THE STORM    4    An experienced Mantis has learned to shatter and demoralize his opponents in court with his mere presence. When initiating a conversation with someone, you may make a Contested Roll of your Intimidation (Control) / Willpower against his Etiquette (Courtesy) / Willpower. If you win the roll, he cannot spend any Void points against you for the next hour. Also, during that time he suffers a –3k0 penalty to all Social Rolls made against you. (This Technique cannot be used again until its effect expires.)    STRENGTH IN ALL THINGS    5    At this Rank the Mantis courtier’s iron willpower and threatening nature have reached perfection, allowing him to overcome all foes and to laugh in the face of threats that would make even a Hida bushi turn pale. Any time you are attempting to use the Intimidation skill against someone else, or are rolling to resist an Intimidation or Temptation Skill Roll or a Fear effect, you gain a bonus of +5k0 to the roll.
Moshi Shugenja    FAVOR OF THE SUN    1    No family has been more reverent of the various incarnations of the Sun throughout their history, and their piety has granted them great favor with the Heavens. During the day, you gain an additional Affi nity for Fire spells. This benefi t is lost at night. You also gain a Free Raise on any spells with the Thunder keyword.
Bayushi Bushi    THE WAY OF THE SCORPION    1    Scorpion bushi always seem to get the jump on opponents. You gain a bonus of +1k1 to your Initiative Rolls. You also gain a bonus of +5 to your Armor TN against any opponent with lower Initiative.    PINCERS AND TAIL    2    The infamous Scorpion feint has been the demise of many foolhardy samurai. You may make the Feint Maneuver for one Raise instead of two.    STRIKE AT THE TAIL    3    Scorpion bushi strive to keep their enemies off guard, stopping their attacks and slowing them down. When you assume a Stance at the start of your Turn, you may choose a target within 30’. If you successfully hit him during your Turn, the target is Fatigued as if he had gone without rest for 24 hours. During the Reactions Stage, an affected opponent may attempt an Earth Ring roll against a TN of 25 to negate the effects of this Technique. If he fails, the effects of this Technique end during the next Reactions Stage (the second Reactions Stage after he was struck).    STRIKE FROM ABOVE, STRIKE FROM BELOW    4    The swiftness of the Scorpion allows him to cut down foes before they realize they have been attacked. You may make melee attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action.    THE PINCERS HOLD, THE TAIL STRIKES    5    Striking an opponent’s weakest point is the Scorpion’s true path to victory. Once per encounter, you may spend a Void Point as a Complex Action to attack your opponent with a me-lee meleeWeapon. If the attack is successful, the target is Stunned. During the Reactions Stage, an affected opponent may attempt an Earth Ring roll against a TN equal to the amount of damage dealt to end the Stun effect. If he fails or does not attempt this roll, the Stun effect ends during the next Reactions Stage (the second Reactions Stage after he was struck).
Bayushi Courtier    WEAKNESS IS MY STRENGTH    1    The Bayushi are masters at ferreting out and exploiting the weaknesses and failures of others. Even if they do not know the exact nature of a rival’s secrets, the mere realization that he has some sort of secret is enough for them to work with. When you are making a Contested Social Roll against someone else, you gain a Free Raise to your roll for every 3 points of Mental or Social Disadvantages (rounded off) he possesses. Disadvantages which did not award Experience Points still count for their normal point value for the purposes of this Technique. This technique cannot award more than 5 Free Raises. The Bayushi are also known as the masters of both truth and lies, speaking so smoothly that both are indistinguishable in their mouths. You gain a Free Raise when using the Courtier skill to spread gossip, and need not Raise in order to conceal that you are the source of that gossip.    SHALLOW WATERS    2    The Scorpion know how to assess others, sensing their weaknesses so as to determine how best to bring them down. By conversing with someone for a few minutes, you can make a Contested Roll of your Investigation / Awareness against their Etiquette / Awareness. With a success, you learn the identity and rank of their lowest Mental Trait and their lowest Social Skill that has at least one Rank (the GM chooses in the case of ties). You may spend a Void point to also learn their next lowest Mental Trait and next lowest Social Skill.    ECRETS ARE BIRTHMARKS    3    At this rank, the Scorpion has become so adept at ferreting out secrets that he can lure others into revealing them in casual conversation. By speaking with someone for a few minutes, you may make a Contested Roll of your Courtier (Manipulation) / Awareness against their Etiquette (Courtesy) / Awareness to force them into revealing one Mental or Social Disadvantage they possess. If they have no such Disadvantages, this will instead reveal one Mental or Social Advantage. (Note this will only reveal the rulebook title of the Advantage / Disadvantage, not the specific nature of it. For example, you might learn that the target has “Dark Secret,” but not the specific nature of the secret.) If the roll succeeded in revealing a Disadvantage, with the GM’s permission you may take a 2-point Blackmail Advantage against this individual, for no cost in Experience Points.    SCRUTINY’S SWEET STING    4    At this rank, the Bayushi Courtier has learned to use all the information he has collected to subtly wreck his enemies, undermining their every word and deed. Any time you make a Contested Social Skill Roll against someone on whom you have Blackmail, his dice cannot explode. In addition, any time you make a Contested Social Skill Roll against someone, regardless of whether you have Blackmail on them or not, you may spend a Void point to force them to use a mental Trait of your choice (instead of the normal Trait used for the roll).    NO MORE MASKS    5    The final lesson of the Bayushi School is to force the rest of the court to see the corrupt, dishonorable world he knows, shattering the reputations of those he speaks against. A number of times per session equal to your School Rank, you may make an Opposed Social Roll of Courtier (Gossip) / Awareness against an opponent’s Etiquette (Courtesy) / Awareness. If you have Blackmail on the person you are targeting with this technique, you gain a bonus of +5k0 to total of this roll. With a success, you may inflict one social Disadvantage on the target: Bad Reputation, Sworn Enemy, or Obligation (to someone of your choice). The Disadvantage lasts for one month, unless the GM judges that the target has taken action which can expunge it sooner. (This Technique cannot be used on the same target again until its effect expires.)
Shosuro Infiltrator    THE PATH OF SHADOWS    1    The first lesson of an infiltrator is to mask all signs of one’s true nature. You lose no Honor for use of Low Skills or Ninjutsu Weapons in the service of the Scorpion Clan (subject to GM approval). You gain a bonus of +2k0 to the total of all Stealth Skill Rolls.    STRIKE FROM DARKNESS    2    A student of the Shosuro Techniques never fails to exploit any advantage held over a foe. Whenever you declare an attack against an opponent who is unaware of your presence until the moment of the attack, your Raises are not limited by your Void and you roll additional dice equal to your School Rank on the attack roll. You also roll half this number of additional unkept dice on an attack roll made against an opponent who is suffering from a Condition effect (such as Stunned or Fatigued). These two effects are not cumulative, and if both could apply, you must choose one of them. (You do not add one and one half times your School Rank in dice to an attack roll against an opponent who is both Blinded and unaware of your presence, for example.)    STEEL WITHIN SILK    3    Striking quickly and effectively is the hallmark of a true shadow warrior. When attacking from ambush as described above, or when using ninjutsu weapons (including any weapons with the Ninja keyword), you may make a melee attack (or ranged  attack, in the case of shuriken or tsubute) as a Simple Action rather than a Complex Action.    WHISPER OF STEEL    4    A master assassin strikes from shadow without ever revealing his presence. Even after attacking a target, your opponents and bystanders must succeed at a Contested Roll using Investigation (Notice) / Perception against Stealth / Agility to detect you. You may only use this Technique if you make a single attack per round. (The GM may rule that this technique does not work in situations where concealment is impossible.)    THE FINAL SILENCE    5    The true assassin requires but a single strike. After you make a damage roll as a result of a successful attack, you may spend a Void Point to increase any two dice to show 10s. These 10s do not explode. You may spend multiple Void Points in this manner, with each Void Point spent increasing the result of up to two damage dice.
Mirumoto Bushi    WAY OF THE DRAGON    1    Initiates of the Mirumoto Bushi School must master the basic principles of Niten, the two-sword technique founded by Mirumoto  himself. When wielding a katana in your main hand and a wakizashi in your off hand, you suffer no penalties of any kind for dual wielding, and you gain a bonus of your School Rank to your Armor TN (this is cumulative with the normal bonus for wielding two weapons). Additionally, when you are targeted with a spell, you may raise or lower the TN of that spell’s Spellcasting Roll by 5.    THE CALM IN MIDST OF THUNDER    2    In addition to their focus on the art of kenjutsu, the Mirumoto study the art of the duel as well in order to properly face their traditional opponents among the Kakita. While you assume the Center Stance, you gain a bonus to the total of your Iaijutsu rolls equal to your Kenjutsu Skill Rank.    STRONG AND SWIFT    3    As the exploration of Niten continues, the student learns to overwhelm opponents with a flurry of blows while maintaining a superior defense. Attacking is a Simple Action for you while you use weapons with the Samurai keyword.    FURIOUS RETALIATION    4    Once an opponent presents himself as a threat, the Mirumoto will stop at nothing to defeat him to defend the honor of the family’s teachings. During the Reactions Stage of Combat, you may choose one opponent who made or attempted an attack against you this Round. During your next Turn, you gain a bonus of +3k0 to all attack rolls against that target.    HEART OF THE DRAGON    5    Masters of the Mirumoto Bushi School seem to strike from everywhere at once. If you attack twice in the same Turn while you are wielding a katana in your main hand and a wakizashi in your off hand, you may make one additional attack with your off hand as a Free Action.
Agasha Shugenja    ELEMENTS OF ALL THINGS    1    The Agasha understand the interactions of the elements more so than perhaps any other family. When casting a spell, you may spend a Void Point to use a different Ring of your choosing rather than the appropriate Ring for that spell. This spell uses a spell slot for the Ring used to actually cast the spell. You also gain a Free Raise on any spell with the Craft keyword.
Kitsuki Investigator    KITSUKI’S METHOD    1    The Kitsuki are masters of investigation and perception, noticing the most minute and telling details with merely a glance. You gain a Free Raise on all your Investigation Skill Rolls. However, while the Kitsuki are trained for investigation and diplomacy, unlike other courtiers they do not wholly neglect the ways of the warrior. In a skirmish, you add your Perception Trait Rank to your Armor TN.    WISDOM THE WIND BRINGS    2    The Kitsuki skill at noticing small details makes it very difficult to deceive them. Anyone making a Social Skill Roll for the purpose of lying to you or otherwise deceiving you, or making a Feint or Disarm Maneuver against you in a skirmish, must add +5 to their TN for each of your Kitsuki Investigator School Ranks.    KNOW THE RHYTHM OF THE HEART    3    The Kitsuki study a secret methodology known as Ichi Miru, or “fi rst look,” which allows them to size up another person in almost a single glance. After speaking with someone for a few moments, you can roll Investigation (Notice) / Perception against a TN of their Intelligence x 5. A success grants you a true and accurate, if simple, picture of their personality and motivations. For example, you might perceive that a boisterous ronin is actually a calculating man who is trying to put on the picture of being a rude, simple fellow.    FINDING THE PATH    4    The Kitsuki has learned the art of uncovering and tracking others’ social connections and networks of alliances. By conversing with someone for a few minutes, you can make a Contested Roll of your Investigation (Interrogation) / Intelligence against their Etiquette (Courtesy) / Intelligence to identify one of their allies or enemies. Each successful Raise you make on this roll will identify another of their allies or enemies (you choose whether you learn an ally or an enemy – the GM chooses which specific person is revealed). This technique can be used against each specific person once per day.    THE EYES BETRAY THE HEART    5    Kitsuki’s method allows its master practitioners to see through even the most practiced falsehoods and tricks. At this rank, any knowing attempt to lie to you (as opposed to unwittingly passing on false information) will almost certainly fail. You automatically make a Contested Roll of your Investigation (Interrogation) / Perception against the liar’s Sincerity (Deceit) / Willpower, whether or not you suspect them of lying. Further, if you already know someone is lying to you, you gain a bonus of +5k0 on this Contested Roll, and may call Raises on the roll in an attempt to make them inadvertently give away more information than they intended (GM’s choice what information they reveal).
Togashi Monk    BLOOD OF THE KAMI    1    The blood of the Kami is barely diluted in the ruling line of the Togashi order, and the brothers chosen to serve the Dragon as Togashi vassals receive the mystical blood of a god in the form of unique tattoos. You gain two Tattoos at this rank.    BODY OF STONE    2    Mastery of the body is the fi rst essential step of a monk’s journey toward enlightenment, and martial arts are the perfect tool to bring the body and spirit into harmony. You gain a bonus of +1k1 to the total of all unarmed attack and damage rolls.    BLESSING OF THE KAMI    3    As an ise zumi continues his journey of self-discovery, accumulating new experiences along the way, he will eventually be judged worthy of additional insight in the form of new tattoos. You gain two additional Tattoos.    WILL OF STONE    4    Perfect mastery of the flesh is an indication that a soul’s journey is nearing its end. You may make unarmed attacks as a Simple Action rather than a Complex Action.    TOUCH OF THE KAMI    5    Insight into the true nature of the universe is the reward for a soul that seeks true mastery of the spirit. You gain two additional Tattoos.
Shiba Bushi    THE WAY OF THE PHOENIX    1    Shiba bushi move through battle as the Void moves through all the elements. When spending a Void Point to gain +1k1 on a roll, you may choose to spend 2 Void Points (to gain +2k2) on the roll instead. You may Guard as a Free Action; however, if you do so, your target only adds +5 to his Armor TN instead of +10.    DANCING WITH THE ELEMENTS    2    Shiba bushi become attuned to the shugenja they protect, aiding their spells and deterring those of their enemies. When you assume your Stance for the Round, you may choose a target within 30’. Whenever your target casts or is the target of a spell, you may choose to increase or decrease the TN of the spell by 5. Additionally, whenever you are the target of a spell, you may immediately choose to increase or decrease the TN of the spell by 5.    ONE WITH THE VOID    3    In battle, the Shiba can find his place in the world. This Technique automatically activates during the Reactions Stage of Combat if another character spent a Void Point during this Combat Round. You regain a Void Point. This Void Point may exceed your maximum, but all excess Void Points are lost after combat resolves. You do not learn anything regarding the source of the Void Point or how it was originally spent. This Technique only activates twice per skirmish.    MOVE WITH THE WORLD    4    Serenity brings certainty, and certainty brings speed. You may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action while using Polearms, Spears, or weapons with the Samurai keyword.    TOUCH OF THE VOID    5    Masters of the Shiba style can draw back the veil and allow the universe to act through them. For every Void Point you spend, you gain the effects of spending two, when applicable. Additionally, you may now spend Void Points on enhancements (as listed in the Book of Earth) twice in one Turn.
Isawa Shugenja    ISAWA'S GIFT    1    There are no greater masters of the shugenja tradition than those among the Isawa. You gain a Free Raise on all Spell Casting Rolls for spells of the element which you chose as your Affinity.
Asako Loremaster    TEMPLE OF THE SOUL    1    The Asako are historians and scholars, and their studies are broader than those of any others in the Empire. They pride themselves on the depth of their knowledge in all fi elds of intellectual endeavor. They also share the Phoenix devotion to peace and civility, relying on genteel discourse to resolve problems. You gain a Free Raise on any Skill Roll with a Lore Skill. Any time you spend a Void point on an Etiquette Skill Roll, you gain a bonus of +3k1 to the total of the roll instead of the normal +1k1.    FROM THE ASHES    2    The Asako Loremasters’ in-depth study of historical events allows them to detect subtle patterns of behavior in every court, patterns invisible to their more worldly rivals from other Clans. After spending at least one day observing the events in a particular court, you can roll Lore: History / Perception at TN 20 to gain a bonus +2k0 to the total of all your Social Skill Rolls for the next two days, so long as you remain in that court. (This Technique’s effect can be re-activated with another skill roll when it expires – it is not necessary to spend additional days observing so long as you remain in the same court.)    VOICE OF THE UNIVERSE    3    As the Asako’s training progresses, his recall of obscure historical facts allows him to provide useful contemporary advice to his allies. You may spend an hour conversing with a friend or ally and then roll Lore: History / Intelligence at TN 25. With a success, that ally may add your Lore: History Skill Rank to the total of any Social Skill Rolls he makes within the next twenty-four hours. You may Raise twice to affect one (and only one) additional ally, provided that ally also participates in the conversation. (This Technique cannot be used on the same person again until its effect expires.)    INVINCIBLE MIND    4    The enlightened and educated Asako can see through the games, tricks, and deceits of the material world. Any time you fail a Contested Social Skill Roll to resist someone trying to influence your emotions, opinions, or behavior (such as with the Courtier, Temptation, or Intimidation skills), you may re-roll using Intelligence as the Trait for the second roll in place of whichever Trait was originally required. You must keep the results of the second roll. This Technique cannot be used to resist Fear.    WISDOM OF THE AGES    5    At this rank, the Asako truly demonstrate that the wisdom of the Phoenix is eternal. Any time you are rolling a Lore Skill, including for your other School Techniques, you gain a +5k0 bonus to the total of the roll.
Akodo Bushi    THE WAY OF THE LION    1    Bushi of the Akodo School hone their fury until it is as precise as a blade. You may either ignore the portion of an opponent’s Armor TN derived from Armor, or gain a Free Raise when attacking. (You do not ignore Reduction from the Armor while choosing the first option.) Also, you gain a bonus of +1k0 to the total of all attack rolls on your first melee attack against an opponent in a skirmish, or against any opponent who has declared a Raise on an attack against you since your last turn. You add only a total of 1k0 for an enemy who Raised against you, no matter how many times they actually Raised.    STRENGTH OF PURITY    2    Akodo-trained warriors are known for their dedication to bushido, and take a fierce satisfaction in defeating dishonorable foes. During a skirmish you may add your Honor Rank to the total of any single roll during your Turn. You may not increase damage rolls in this fashion, nor can you do this while assuming the Center Stance.    STRENGTH OF MY ANCESTORS    3    The Akodo bushi attacks twice, once for himself and once for his ancestors. You may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action while using weapons with the Samurai keyword.    TRIUMPH BEFORE BATTLE    4    No foe is beyond the reach of the devoted Lion warrior. Once per skirmish, you may designate an opponent during the Reactions Stage. You may ignore any Armor TN bonuses your target receives from his Stance during the next Round.    AKODO’S FINAL LESSON    5    Mastery of the Akodo Bushi School imparts an unshakable faith in victory. When you make Raises on any Bugei Skill Roll, if you meet or exceed the original TN (before Raises) but fail to meet the Raised TN, you still succeed without the benefits of Raises.
Matsu Berserker    THE LION’S ROAR    1    Warriors of the Matsu School respect their Akodo cousins’ leadership skills, but they know that a furious attack often simply overwhelms an enemy. You add your Honor Rank to all damage rolls. Whenever you assume the Full Attack Stance, you may move an additional 5 feet per Turn in addition to the bonus you receive from the Stance. (This does not allow you to move farther than your maximum move per Turn.)    MATSU’S FURY    2    The target of a Matsu’s fury has little hope of victory. When you assume the Full Attack Stance, choose an opponent within 30’. If you successfully hit him this Turn, the target is frozen with fear and cannot take Move Actions to move from his current position. During the Reactions Stage, an affected opponent may attempt a Willpower roll against a TN equal to the amount of damage dealt from your latest attack to negate the effects of this Technique (the opponent does not suffer penalties from his Wound Rank for this roll). If he fails, the effects of this Technique end during the next Reactions Stage (the second after he was struck). Enemies who are immune to Fear cannot be affected by this Technique.    THE LION’S CHARGE    3    When a Lion strikes, he grants the gift of final rest to all who stand against him. You may make melee attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action.    MATSU’S COURAGE    4    Death means nothing in the face of the loss of honor, and no Matsu will yield while he yet draws breath. You ignore TN penalties from Wound Levels equal to your Honor Rank, or twice your Honor Rank while in the Full Attack Stance.    THE LION’S VICTORY    5    The death of an opponent is the only measure of victory for a Matsu. Once per encounter after you roll damage for an attack, you may spend a Void Point as a Free Action to activate this Technique. You rend the opponent, ripping open his wounds and dealing grievous injury to him. All of the dice you chose to keep explode, re-rolling and adding the result to your damage total.
Ikoma Bard    THE HERALD OF GLORY    1    The Ikoma are historians and storytellers, tasked with recording the glorious deeds of others for posterity, ensuring that courageous and honorable accomplishments are never forgotten. You gain the Precise Memory Advantage for no cost in Experience Points (if you already have Precise Memory, you are refunded that many Experience Points). You may use the Perform: Storytelling skill to engage in public bragging on behalf of another person. If you can cite heroic or noble actions by that person and successfully roll Perform: Storytelling / Awareness at TN 20, that person will gain a number of points of Glory equal to your School Rank. This may be done a number of times per person per month equal to your School Rank.    THE HEART OF THE LION    2    The Ikoma are tasked with conveying the emotions which the rest of the Clan keeps bottled away in stoic rectitude. You do not lose Honor or Glory for displaying emotion in public, so long as you do so on behalf of another Lion or for an honorable cause greater than yourself (such as your clan, the Empire, or the Code of Bushido). At the same time, your understanding of both honor and emotion strengthens your own soul against temptation. Anyone attempting to sway your emotions through the use of the Intimidation or Temptation skills must add +5 to their TN for each of your School Ranks.    THE VOICE OF THE ANCESTORS    3    The Ikoma act as Battle-Criers for the Lion, inspiring their soldiers on the battlefield with tales of the heroic deeds of their ancestors. Prior to a battle or skirmish, you may inspire your allies by speaking for a few minutes and rolling Perform: Oratory / Awareness at a TN equal to 15 + 5 per person you are inspiring. Targets who are not members of the Lion Clan increase the TN by 5 for each such person. With a successful roll, each person you inspired may add their Honor Rank to the total of any one Skill Roll during that battle or skirmish. (If this benefit is not used by the end of the battle, it is lost.)    THE STRENGTH OF TRADITION    4    The Ikoma’s steadfast encouragement calls on the examples of noble ancestors to infuse their allies with a strength they did not know they had. A number of times per session equal to your School Rank, as a Simple Action, you may verbally encourage an ally with a tale of great deeds from the past, rolling Perform: Storytelling/Awareness at TN 25. With a success, the next time during the same day that the chosen ally fails a roll, he may re-roll it, adding your Honor Rank in unkept dice to his roll. However, if he fails this second roll, you lose 2 points of Honor.    EVERY LION IS YOUR BROTHER    5    The Ikoma’s understanding of Bushido, history, emotion, and human nature empowers them in court, filling their arguments with the ringing power of generations of noble Lion, and calling on the precedents of a thousand years and more to support their cause. Five times per session, when you are making a Contested Social Roll against an opponent, you may cite historical precedent to support your views and roll additional unkept dice equal to your Rank in Perform: Storytelling. (In situations where citing history seems inappropriate or strange, the GM has the final say on whether this Technique may be used.)
Kitsu Shugenja    EYES OF THE ANCESTORS    1     The Kitsu are descended from mystical creatures, and as such are able to reach across the veil between worlds and speak with their ancestors. You may make a Spell Casting Roll (as though casting a Water spell) against a target’s Willpower x 5. If successful, you learn all Spiritual Advantages or Disadvantages that individual possesses. By spending a Void Point, you may negate any one Spiritual Advantage an opponent possesses for a number of minutes equal to your School Rank. You also gain a Free Raise on any spell with the Battle keyword.
Hida Bushi    THE WAY OF THE CRAB    1    The Hida bushi is the epitome of ‘heavy infantry,’ able to endure harsh blows and deliver crushing attacks in return. You may ignore TN penalties for wearing heavy armor for all skills except Stealth. When using a Heavy Weapon, you gain a bonus of +1k0 to the total of all damage rolls.    THE MOUNTAIN DOES NOT MOVE    2    The Hida bushi is famous for extraordinary tenacity, weathering wounds that would kill normal men. You gain Reduction equal to your Earth Ring.    TWO PINCERS , ONE MIND    3    A Hida bushi is relentless. You may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action while using Heavy Weapons or weapons with the Samurai keyword.    DEVASTATING BLOW    4    A Hida stops at nothing to destroy his enemies once his anger is roused. Once per encounter, when wielding a Heavy Weapon you may make a calculated strike against the enemy. Lower the enemy’s Reduction by 4 for this attack. If this attack succeeds, you Daze the target. The target may recover from this Conditional Effect by making a successful Earth Ring Roll versus a TN equal to your damage roll during the Reaction Stage of each Round. The TN decreases by 5 each time the target fails the roll.    THE MOUNTAIN DOES NOT FALL    5    Nothing can stop a Hida warrior from fulfi lling his duty, not even the threat of death. You may spend a Void Point during the Reactions Stage. During your next Turn, you may take actions as if you were in the Healthy Wound Rank. You ignore the Dazed, Fatigued, and Stunned Conditional Effects. The benefits of this Technique last until the next Reactions Stage.
Kuni Shugenja    GAZE INTO SHADOW    1    The Kuni have carefully studied many of the most sinister opponents imaginable, and have learned how to combat them. You gain a bonus of +1k0 to the total of all Spell Casting Rolls when the target is any non-human creature, and any spell that infl icts damage infl icts an additional +1k1 damage when used against a target who possesses the Shadowlands Taint. You also gain a Free Raise on any spell with the Jade keyword.
Yasuki Courtier   THE WAY OF THE CARP    1    The Yasuki are masters of commerce and practice it far more openly than other samurai families; they do not consider it to be a breach of etiquette to engage in open commerce. You gain a Free Raise when using the Commerce skill, and you do not lose Honor or Glory for using the Commerce skill even in public. Also, Yasuki are taught from youth to be adept at sizing up their potential customers. When speaking with someone you may make a Contested Roll of your Commerce/Perception against their Etiquette/Awareness to discern some material object or service they want or desire.     DO AS WE SAY    2    The flip side of Yasuki commerce is Yasuki pushiness. The Yasuki are renowned for both their glib tongues and their high-pressure sales tactics, pressuring and deceiving their customers and allies into doing what they want. A number of times per session equal to your School Rank, you may re-roll a failed Sincerity or Intimidation Skill roll. You must keep the results of the second roll.    TREASURES OF THE CARP    3    Your contacts in the merchant and commercial circles of Rokugan make it possible for you to acquire almost anything you might need to satisfy a customer. You may roll Commerce/Awareness at TN 20 to locate a rare or useful item, subject to GM discretion, for someone else. You may track down higher-quality or rarer items by calling Raises.    WILES OF THE CARP    4    As ruthless merchants, the Yasuki are also skilled at seeing through the deceptions and blandishments of others. Anyone making a Social Skill Roll for the purpose of lying to you or deceiving you has their TN increased by an amount equal to 5 times your School Rank.     WHAT IS YOURS IS MINE    5    The ultimate skill of the Yasuki is to infl uence others by offering them what they want the most. If you know of a material item someone needs, and arrange for them to get it, you gain a bonus of +5k0 to any Contested Social Rolls you make against that person for the next 24 hours. 
Hiruma Bushi    TORCH’S FLAME FLICKERS    1    The Hiruma learns to focus his strikes even while protecting himself, perfecting the penetrating quality of his blow without sacrificing his defense. While you assume the Attack Stance, you gain a bonus of +1k0 to the total of all attack rolls. You are skilled at survival and can make all food, water, and jade rations last twice as long for a number of people equal to your Hunting Skill Rank.    WOLF’S LITTLE LESSON    2    Hiruma learn to dash in and out in a single motion. While you assume the Attack Stance, you add 5 to your Armor TN every time you hit with a melee weapon. This bonus may stack a number of times equal to your School Rank and lasts until the end of the current skirmish.    HUMMINGBIRD WINGS    3    The Hiruma know how the hummingbird can move in any direction and apply this truism to battle. Once per Round you may activate this Technique when an opponent targets you with an attack. You gain a bonus of double your School Rank to your Armor TN for that attack. This stacks with any other Armor TN bonuses you gain from other means (such as spending a Void Point).    SHARK SMELLS BLOOD    4    Against a weakened opponent, a Hiruma is a terrible foe indeed. You may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action when using a weapon with the Samurai keyword.    DAYLIGHT WASTES NO MOVEMENT    5    The Hiruma learns to use no more energy than is precisely needed to kill his opponent. If you deliver more Wounds than necessary to kill your target, you may apply the excess Wounds to the next target you hit. This Technique does not activate two attacks in a row. The carry-over effect does not last beyond the end of the current skirmish.
Daigotsu Bushi    THE WAY OF THE SPIDER    1    The Daigotsu Bushi must walk the fi ne line between using the Taint to power his body and hiding its effects in public. At the beginning of each Round, you may choose to either reduce TN penalties from Wound Ranks by your Strength Trait Rank plus your Taint Rank until the end of the Round, or increase your damage rolls by the same amount. Additionally, the TN on any roll made to detect the presence or effects of the Shadowlands Taint on you is increased by 10.    AURA OF BLOOD    2    The presence of the Daigotsu Bushi can be unsettling to those who are unprepared to face it. You may spend a Void Point as a Simple Action to activate this Technique. While this Technique is active, you and all of your allies within 30’ add +2k0 to the total of all damage rolls. This lasts for a number of Rounds equal to your Taint Rank plus your Strength Trait Rank. This bonus is not cumulative with other applications of Aura of Blood. Using this Technique while under its effects refreshes its duration.    ASHURA’S WING    3    The Daigotsu Bushi moves and strikes as swiftly as ash borne away by the wind. You may make melee attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action.    DEVOURING WRATH    4    By the power of Fu Leng, the Legionnaire feeds on the strength of his enemies. Any time you hit an opponent in melee, you immediately regain 5 Wounds. This can potentially grant additional Wounds beyond your normal maximum, but this bonus will not increase over 20 Wounds. Excess Wounds are lost at the end of the skirmish.    INHUMAN ASSAULT    5    The wrath of a Daigotsu bushi is like that of a rampaging beast. Once per skirmish, you may launch into a series of bone-shattering blows by making a melee attack as a Complex Action. This attack ignores the bonuses and effects of armor (including Reduction from armor) and any Stance the target assumes. If the strike hits, the target cannot gain the bonuses of armor or Stance to his Armor TN for a number of Rounds equal to your Taint Rank plus your Strength Trait. If your opponent is in the Full Attack Posture, he still retains the -10 Armor TN penalty.
Chuda Shugenja    Blood Like Water    1    The Chuda have existed for centuries, hidden among the people of Rokugan and concealing the true nature of their dark arts. When casting a maho spell, you may declare one Raise to conceal the corrupted nature of the magic. The spell functions exactly as normal, but there will be no outward sign that it is anything other than traditional elemental magic. You may declare a second Raise to reduce all Shadowlands Taint normally acquired by a maho spell to only one Point, regardless of the spell’s Mastery level. Alternatively, you may sacrifice one point of Honor to reduce all Taint normally acquired by the spell to one Point.
Daigotsu Courtier    INSIDIOUS WHISPERS    1    Every student of the Daigotsu Courtiers is accomplished at the art of masking his nature, preventing his true intentions and capabilities from being discovered by others. You are skilled at hiding your intentions and the symptoms of Taint. You gain a Free Raise when using Sincerity (Deceit). Any rolls made to detect your Taint (such as the techniques of the Kuni) have their TN increased by an amount equal to 5 x your School Rank. You add your School Rank to your Honor Rank whenever another is attempting to discern your Honor Rank.    CRACKS IN THE WALL    2    The Daigotsu courtier is taught to drop subtle, seemingly innocuous conversational hints that disrupt the focus and attention of those around him. Any time you are engaged in conversation, you may spend a Void point and make a Courtier (Manipulation) / Awareness roll (as a Simple Action) at TN 25 to force everyone within 20 feet of you to suffer a penalty of –1k1 to all their Etiquette and Perform Skill rolls for the next hour. They are not aware of the source for their lack of focus. This effect cannot be stacked.     DARKNESS CANNOT BE TRAPPED    3    At this rank, the Spider courtier is taught to defl ect attention and blame from himself, spreading disharmony among his foes while avoiding the price of his own actions.Any time you are the focus of suspicion or accusation, you may spend a Void point as a Simple Action to try to shift the blame to someone else who is present at the moment of the accusation.You must make a Contested Roll of your Sincerity(Deciet)/Awareness versus the victim’s Sincerity(Honest)/Awareness in order to make the shifting of blame stick.(If your attempt seems weak or poorly justified, the GM can award bonuses to your victim’s attempt to defend himself.) With a success,everyone who heard you will believe your target is the real culprit, until presented with evidence to the contrary.This technique cannot be used to get out of situations in which you are clearly and inescapably guilty, or to pin the blame on someone not present.    THE TOUCH OF SIN    4    At this level of training, the Spider’s mastery of manipulation and misdirection allows his words to twist the thoughts of others, temporarily leading them into weakness, aggression, and confusion. A number of times per session equal to your School Rank, you may speak with someone for a few minutes and then make a Contested Roll of your Courtier (Manipulation) / Willpower against their Etiquette (Courtesy) / Willpower. If you succeed, they acquire one of the seven Consumed by Shourido Disadvantages (your choice) for a number of hours equal to your School Rank. By calling two successful Raises on this roll, you can infl ict a second Consumed by Shourido Disadvantage of your choice on the same person for the same period of time. (You cannot use this technique on the same person twice in the same day.)     THE EMBRACE OF DARKNESS    5    The final lesson of the Daigotsu Courtier School teaches its students to lead their enemies into paths of aggression and violence. By speaking with someone for at least fifteen minutes, you may make a Contested Roll of your Sincerity (Deceit) / Awareness against their Etiquette (Courtesy) / Perception. If your target currently has one of the Consumed by Shourido Disadvantages, you gain a +5k0 bonus to this roll. With a success, you may convince your target to treat some other person, group, institution, or clan as their enemy. This cannot be used to turn someone directly against his lord or the Emperor. Subject to that limitation, the target will continue to believe in this enmity until presented with evidence to the contrary.This technique cannot be used against the same person more than once per month. 
Order Of The Spider Monks    THE DARK PATH    1    The Order of the Spider teaches strength and mastery of oneself, even the darkness that hides within the soul. You gain a bonus of +1k0 to the total of all attack rolls made using unarmed strikes or with polearms. You also add twice your School Rank to your Armor TN against all melee attacks.    DRAWING IN THE STRIKE    2    Mastery of the body is a step to the path of power, and this mastery affords tremendous endurance to those who reach it. You may select any non-Void Ring. You gain Reduction equal to this Ring, plus your Rank in the Shadowlands Taint, if you possess any    SPEED OF DARKNESS    3    The alignment of body and mind allow tremendous speed. When using a polearm or an unarmed attack, you may make melee attacks as Simple Actions rather than Complex Actions.    GUARDED BY CHI    4    Following mastery of the body comes mastery of the soul. When you learn this Technique, you may select any one non-Void Ring. You add twice your Rank in this Ring, plus your Shadowlands Taint Rank (if you possess any), to the TN of any spell being cast against you. You may choose to suppress this effect if you wish.    DARKNESS UNLEASHED    5    True mastery of the self requires drawing upon the darkness within. You gain an additional number of Void Points per day equal to your Shadowlands Taint rank or your Earth Ring, whichever is higher. These may be spent exactly like normal Void Points, except they may also be spent to add a bonus of +1k1 to the total of your damage rolls.
