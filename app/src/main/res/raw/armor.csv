ASHIGARU ARMOR    3    1    Much less expensive to produce than either light or heavy samurai armor, ashigaru armor is also lighter, less restrictive, and less protective than traditional light and heavy armor. It consists of plates that protect the head, torso, and upper legs. It is not unheard of for scouts among the samurai caste to wear ashigaru armor in lieu of traditional samurai armor to afford them greater mobility in the execution of their duties.Ronin also wear it because of its affordability.
LIGHT ARMOR    5    3    Far and away the most common armor worn by samurai in the armies of the Great Clans, light armor is the standard by which other armor is measured. The overlapping plates protect primarily the torso, head, upper arms and upper legs, but the lower arms and legs are left largely uncovered in order to prevent excessive loss of mobility or range of movement. Light armor is generally favored by scouts and infantry, particularly infantry that needs to move quickly on the battlefi eld.
HEAVY ARMOR    10    5    While light armor is frequently worn by scouts or rapid infantry, heavy armor is preferred by troops on the front lines or those who are expected to be in the thickest part of the fi ghting. Heavy armor protects the entire body, including the arms, legs, hands, feet, and face, which is protected by a full helm called a kabuto. While the wearerâ€™s mobility is signifi cantly impacted, many consider the increased protection well worth the effort.
